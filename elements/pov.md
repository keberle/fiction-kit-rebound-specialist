# POV Style: The Rebound Specialist

## Perspective: Ensemble Third-Person Close

Each scene uses **third-person close** anchored to a single POV character.

### Allowed POV Characters
- Doogan Andrews (default)
- Eddie Palmer
- Abby Palmer
- Rodney Baxter

**Rule:** One POV per scene. Switching POV = new scene.

---

## Third-Person Close Technique

- Use "he," "his," "him" for POV character
- Stay tight to POV character's consciousness
- **NEVER** "He thought..." or "He felt..."—show through action
- No first-person ("I," "my") in narrative
- No authorial commentary

### First-Person Feel
- Dialogue dominates (80-90%)
- Behavior over interiority
- Only what POV character notices, in order noticed
- No explanations

---

## Fair-Play Rule

- Reader learns what POV character learns, when they learn it
- No villain POV
- No omniscient narration

---

## Off-Screen Information Delivery

When events occur without POV character present:

| Method | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| Dialogue recounting | Characters report events (incomplete, biased) |
| Interviews | Protagonist questions witnesses |
| Documents | Reports, texts, receipts, files |
| Messages | Voicemails, texts, emails |
| Media | News clips, social posts |

### Emergency Cutaways (Rare)
- 1-3 paragraphs max
- Objective only (no interiority)
- Never reveal info team shouldn't know

---

## Tense

**Past tense** throughout.

## Third-Person Conversion

| First-Person | Third-Person Close |
|--------------|-------------------|
| I said | Doogan said (or remove tag) |
| I noticed | He noticed / just describe it |
| My thumb traced | His thumb traced |
| I thought | [Delete—show through action] |
