# Gregory McDonald POV Style (Fletch Novels)

## Perspective
- Third-person limited, closely aligned with protagonist's perceptions.
- Internal thoughts presented as quick, sardonic observations.
- **The Fletch Rule:** Reader learns information when the protagonist learns it.
- No villain POV, omniscient narration, or cutaways revealing information the protagonist shouldn't know.

## Tone
- Dry, witty, and ironic.
- Language is economicalshort sentences, heavy reliance on dialogue.

## Structure
- Dialogue-driven narrative; minimal exposition.
- Context implied through speech and action rather than description.
- **Off-screen events are delivered indirectly** through dialogue recounting, interviews, documents, voicemails, news clips, or comedic misunderstandings.

## Temporal Flow
- Linear, real-time progression.
- Backstory revealed through conversation, not lengthy flashbacks.

## Character Perception
- Observational, non-editorializing narrator.
- Focus on behavior and speech over physical description.

## Information Delivery Methods
When events occur off-screen (protagonist not present):
- **Dialogue recounting:** Characters report what happened, often incompletely or with bias
- **Interviews:** Protagonist questions witnesses or participants
- **Documents:** Reports, texts, receipts, files
- **Messages:** Voicemails, texts, emails
- **Media:** News clips, social media posts
- **Bureaucratic summaries:** Official reports, briefings
- **Comedic misunderstandings:** Conflicting accounts create humor

## Minimal Cutaways (Emergency Only)
If a scene must occur without the protagonist:
- Keep it extremely short (13 paragraphs)
- Keep it objective (no emotions or interiority)
- Keep it functional (procedural, bureaucratic)
- Never reveal information the protagonist shouldn't know yet
