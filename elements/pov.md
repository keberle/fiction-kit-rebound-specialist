# Gregory McDonald POV Style (Fletch Novels)

## Perspective: Third-Person Close (with First-Person Feel)
Gregory McDonald's Fletch novels are written in **third-person limited**, not first-person—but they create an intensely intimate, first-person *feel* through several techniques:

- **Third-person pronouns:** "Fletch said," "He walked," "Doogan noticed"
- **Extremely close psychic distance:** The narrative stays tight to the protagonist's consciousness
- **No interior monologue:** Thoughts are revealed through dialogue, action, and behavior—never "He thought..." passages
- **No authorial commentary:** The narrator never editorializes or explains; the reader pieces things together
- **The Fletch Rule:** Reader learns information when the protagonist learns it—no exceptions
- **No villain POV, no omniscient narration, no cutaways** revealing information the protagonist shouldn't know

### Why Third-Person Close Works
- Feels intimate without the artificiality of first-person narration
- Allows the protagonist's voice to emerge through dialogue without filtering through "I"
- Creates an eavesdropper experience—reader observes but isn't directly addressed
- Permits tight focus on the protagonist while maintaining narrative flexibility

### The "First-Person Feel" Techniques
- **Dialogue dominates (80-90%):** The protagonist's voice emerges through what he says, not narrated thoughts
- **Behavior over interiority:** We see what Doogan does, not what he thinks
- **Minimal description:** Only what Doogan would notice, in the order he'd notice it
- **Fast, present-tense rhythm:** Actions described in quick, active prose
- **No explanations:** Jokes aren't explained; subtext isn't spelled out

## Tone
- Dry, witty, and ironic
- Language is economical—short sentences, heavy reliance on dialogue

## Structure
- Dialogue-driven narrative; minimal exposition
- Context implied through speech and action rather than description
- **Off-screen events are delivered indirectly** through dialogue recounting, interviews, documents, voicemails, news clips, or comedic misunderstandings

## Temporal Flow
- Linear, real-time progression
- Backstory revealed through conversation, not lengthy flashbacks

## Character Perception
- Observational, non-editorializing narrator
- Focus on behavior and speech over physical description
- Camera follows Doogan—we see what he sees, when he sees it

## Information Delivery Methods
When events occur off-screen (protagonist not present):
- **Dialogue recounting:** Characters report what happened, often incompletely or with bias
- **Interviews:** Protagonist questions witnesses or participants
- **Documents:** Reports, texts, receipts, files
- **Messages:** Voicemails, texts, emails
- **Media:** News clips, social media posts
- **Bureaucratic summaries:** Official reports, briefings
- **Comedic misunderstandings:** Conflicting accounts create humor

## Minimal Cutaways (Emergency Only)
If a scene must occur without the protagonist:
- Keep it extremely short (1–3 paragraphs)
- Keep it objective (no emotions or interiority)
- Keep it functional (procedural, bureaucratic)
- Never reveal information the protagonist shouldn't know yet

## Third-Person Conversion Guide
When converting from first-person to third-person close:
- "I said" → "Doogan said" or simply remove the tag
- "I noticed" → "He noticed" or describe what's noticed without the verb
- "My thumb was tracing circles" → "His thumb was tracing circles"
- "I'd known it was coming" → "He'd known it was coming"
- Eliminate "I thought" and "I felt"—show through action or dialogue instead
- Keep the same voice, rhythm, and wit—only the pronouns change
