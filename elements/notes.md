# Notes for the story

## Police Procedures (Pacific Point PD)

### Arrest & Interrogation Protocol
- **Holding Cells:** No furniture. Suspects wait standing or sitting on floor. Used for temporary detention before processing or interrogation.
- **Interview/Interrogation Rooms:** Separate rooms with table, chairs, one-way mirror. This is where actual questioning occurs.
- **Procedure:** Detectives retrieve suspect from holding cell → walk to interview room → conduct interrogation.
- **Continuity Note:** Martinez and Finch follow standard procedure when questioning Doogan about Annabelle's murder (Episode 2, Scene 1).

## Communications Technology
- **Doogan's Covert Earpiece:** Doogan wears a nearly invisible, military-grade communications device sourced by Baxter through questionably legal channels (gray-market intelligence equipment dealers found on encrypted forums). Comparable to CIA/Secret Service equipment. Flesh-toned, uses bone conduction technology, practically undetectable even at close range. Doogan wears it almost constantly—only removes it when sleeping, showering, or during intimate moments. This allows Baxter (and the team) to maintain near-constant communication during operations, providing real-time intel, warnings, and coordination. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 2)*
- **Operational Implications:** Unless explicitly stated otherwise, assume the team has audio access to Doogan during operations. Baxter can feed him background information, Eddie can provide tactical advice, and Abby can intervene if things go sideways. The device's invisibility is crucial—targets never realize Doogan is receiving external guidance.
- **Comedy/Tension Potential:** The earpiece creates opportunities for the team to overhear private moments, for device malfunctions at critical times, for discovery threats, and for Doogan having to maintain composure while receiving unexpected information.

## Doogan's Condo (Seduction Headquarters)
- **Location:** High up in a luxury building in Pacific Point's urban high-rise district—more urban than Eddie/Abby's upscale suburbs
- **Living Space:** Immaculate, perfectly decorated with modern urban aesthetic—muted tones, charcoal sectional positioned for view, exposed brick, dark elegance, low coffee table with fresh flowers (regularly swapped out), tv remote and hardback novel, nothing accidental. Not cluttered, just enough to be interesting but nothing too personal, too messy. Feels like a stage set.
- **Windows:** Floor-to-ceiling with panoramic city skyline views
- **Kitchen:** Chef-grade paradise designed for seduction—soapstone countertop veined in dark simplicity, custom walnut cabinetry, commercial six-burner range with griddle, Sub-Zero fridge, German steel knives, copper pots hanging by size
- **Purpose:** This is where Doogan feels most in control; the kitchen is his real superpower for dates—cooking for women in his territory
- **Contrast:** Perfect-but-empty living space vs. kitchen designed for intimacy
- **Inspiration:** Hitch (Will Smith)—bachelor pad ready for seduction
- *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*

## Baxter's Digital Operations
- **Social Media Management:** Baxter creates and maintains carefully crafted social media profiles for Doogan (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) with curated photos (cooking, sailing, lifestyle shots), believable posts, and strategic details. Updates twice weekly to keep algorithms happy and maintain authenticity. Designed to pass background checks and look genuine. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*
- **Transaction History Surveillance:** Baxter can pull credit card/bank transaction histories through gray-area hacking methods. Used to identify patterns (shopping times, favorite locations, spending habits). *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*
- **Effectiveness Evidence:** Annabelle Anders viewed Doogan's Instagram profile four times since their first meeting, scrolled through photos, and read comments on two posts—showing particular interest in the cooking and sailing pics. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*

## The Wine Connection
- The "Woodmark Vineyards" wine that Annabelle got from a client recently is the same "Woodmark" wine that Nurse Nancy happens to have and Doogan is blacked out both times from it
- Eventually, it is confirmed that the drug in the wine is a new variation of Nexapan, a sedative that is specifically intended for oral use and alcohol actually increases its rate of absorbtion
- Doogan remembers the wine label on both bottles and that is the clue that Baxter uses to track down his real identity
- But there's no way that they could have gotten drug into the wine because in both cases, the wine bottles were sealed, with a wrapper on top which would have made syringe delivery of drugs impossible.
- Turns out "Woodmark Vineyards" is also a scam.  Its cheap, dollar store white wine, relabeled by a different con artist who has a connection to John Wipple, who coincidentally looks just like Albert Stans.
- The fake wine scam actually uses boxed wine and fills wine bottles and a custom label.  In fact, that's how the scam first started.  It was a way for sleazy men to buy wine laced in the Rohypnol.

## The Murder Frame-Up Mechanics (Episode 1)
- **Critical Phone Call:** In Scene 8 (Tomato Aisle), Doogan calls Eddie to report "I'm meeting her tonight" at the grocery store. This is ESSENTIAL—Eddie relays this timeline to Sebastian, who needs to know when Doogan will be in Annabelle's apartment so he can send someone to kill her and frame Doogan. Without this call, the murder setup doesn't work. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 8)*
- **The Drugged Wine:** The Woodmark Vineyards wine Annabelle serves is pre-drugged with Nexapan. Both Doogan and Annabelle drink it throughout the cooking/flirting scene. The drug takes 20-30 minutes to take full effect. They progressively get woozy, disoriented, lose coordination. Doogan blacks out BEFORE any sexual activity occurs (maintaining his innocence/the frame-up). Someone enters the apartment while both are unconscious and kills Annabelle, leaving Doogan beside her body. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 9)*
- **Timeline Coordination:** Sebastian needs the specific timing to coordinate the killer's entry. The phone call in Scene 8 provides this. The killer waits for the drug to take effect (approximately 30-40 minutes after dinner starts) before entering.

## Detective Partner
- When Doogan is first questioned by Martinez, he has Detective Finch with him
- But the next time Doogan sees him, he asks Martinez where his partner is
- Martinez chuckles and explains that the buddy cop thing is only for movies and tv shows and that in real life there is a primary investigator and then homicide works in small teams so sometimes there is a detective with him and sometimes there isn't
- This continues when Martinez is questioning Doogan later and has a different detective with him

## Nurse Nancy Character Moments
- At one point, Doogan meets Nurse Nancy for a walk around the park and she brings her dog, who poops while they're walking.  Nancy casually pulls out a poop bag, picks up the poop but as two people are pushing a stroller the other direction she tosses it into the stroller without even breaking looking or breaking her thought while talking.  Doogan of course runs back to fetch the bag, with the people outraged.

## Holding Cell Graffiti
- The first time Doogan is in the holding cell he sees "Julio (heart) Dominique".
- The second time he's in that same holding cell after Nurse Nancy's death the name "Dominique" is crossed out with thin carved lines from something sharp and the words "cheating whore" are written over it.  Doogan thinks "hmmm...that's too bad.  Poor Julio.
- The third time he's in that same holding cell after being arrested by Martinez, the "cheating whore" is scratched out and Dominique's name is back, larger and more emphasized.  "Got to love a happy ending".
