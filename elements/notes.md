# Notes for the story

## The Wine Connection
- The "Woodmark Vineyards" wine that Annabelle got from a client recently is the same "Woodmark" wine that Nurse Nancy happens to have and Doogan is blacked out both times from it
- Eventually, it is confirmed that the drug in the wine is a new variation of Nexapan, a sedative that is specifically intended for oral use and alcohol actually increases its rate of absorbtion
- Doogan remembers the wine label on both bottles and that is the clue that Baxter uses to track down his real identity
- But there's no way that they could have gotten drug into the wine because in both cases, the wine bottles were sealed, with a wrapper on top which would have made syringe delivery of drugs impossible.
- Turns out "Woodmark Vineyards" is also a scam.  Its cheap, dollar store white wine, relabeled by a different con artist who has a connection to John Wipple, who coincidentally looks just like Albert Stans.
- The fake wine scam actually uses boxed wine and fills wine bottles and a custom label.  In fact, that's how the scam first started.  It was a way for sleazy men to buy wine laced in the Rohypnol.

## Detective Partner
- When Doogan is first questioned by Martinez, he has Detective Finch with him
- But the next time Doogan sees him, he asks Martinez where his partner is
- Martinez chuckles and explains that the buddy cop thing is only for movies and tv shows and that in real life there is a primary investigator and then homicide works in small teams so sometimes there is a detective with him and sometimes there isn't
- This continues when Martinez is questioning Doogan later and has a different detective with him

## Nurse Nancy Character Moments
- At one point, Doogan meets Nurse Nancy for a walk around the park and she brings her dog, who poops while they're walking.  Nancy casually pulls out a poop bag, picks up the poop but as two people are pushing a stroller the other direction she tosses it into the stroller without even breaking looking or breaking her thought while talking.  Doogan of course runs back to fetch the bag, with the people outraged.

## Holding Cell Graffiti
- The first time Doogan is in the holding cell he sees "Julio (heart) Dominique".
- The second time he's in that same holding cell after Nurse Nancy's death the name "Dominique" is crossed out with thin carved lines from something sharp and the words "cheating whore" are written over it.  Doogan thinks "hmmm...that's too bad.  Poor Julio.
- The third time he's in that same holding cell after being arrested by Martinez, the "cheating whore" is scratched out and Dominique's name is back, larger and more emphasized.  "Got to love a happy ending".
