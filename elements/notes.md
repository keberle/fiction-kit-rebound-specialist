# Notes for the story

## The Secrecy Rule (STORY-CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Core Premise:** Doogan's rebound business only works if targets never know they're part of a paid operation.

### ⛔ BLOCKING VALIDATION CHECK (MANDATORY BEFORE SCENE COMPLETION) ⛔

**Before finalizing ANY scene with a target present, search target dialogue for these RED FLAG WORDS:**

```
paid | pay | paying | hired | hire | hiring | job | babysit | babysitting | service | charge | cost | money
```

**If ANY red flag word appears in target dialogue → IMMEDIATE REWRITE REQUIRED**

**Exception:** Words used in completely different context (e.g., "pay attention," "service station," "job interview at company X") are acceptable if they have ZERO connection to Doogan's presence or the rebound operation.

**When in doubt:** Rewrite to express skepticism through the COVER STORY framework, not payment/hiring language.

### Why This Matters:
- The entire business model depends on targets believing the connection is genuine
- If targets knew they were hired entertainment, the emotional impact would be destroyed
- Clients pay for authenticity, not performance—targets must believe Doogan's interest is real
- This is a story-breaking violation if targets discover the truth

**Cover Story Examples:**
- **Episode 1 (Annabelle):** "Coincidental" grocery store encounter, mutual dog lover connection
- **Episode 2 (Cheryl):** "Family friend" setup by her parents, blind date for the wedding weekend

**How Targets Express Skepticism (Acceptable):**
- Questioning whether the connection is genuine: "You're too good to be true"
- Suspicion about convenient timing: "My parents set me up with someone perfect—that's suspicious"
- Doubting his authenticity: "You're really good at this. Almost too good."
- Emotional walls: "I don't trust this. It feels like a setup."
- Within cover story: "You're being nice because my parents asked you to"
- Within cover story: "You're here doing a favor for them"

**What Targets NEVER Say (Violations):**
- ❌ "My parents paid you"
- ❌ "You're paid to not mind"
- ❌ "How much are they paying you?"
- ❌ "Is this your job?"
- ❌ "You're babysitting me"
- ❌ "Whatever you're hired to do"
- ❌ "What do they pay you for this?"

**The Discovery Moment (If It Happens):**
If a target ever learns the truth, it becomes a major plot event:
- The job ends immediately
- Emotional fallout is severe (betrayal, humiliation)
- Potential consequences: reputation damage, legal threat, personal danger
- This has NOT happened in Episodes 1-2 and should only happen when the story is ready for that level of crisis

## Writing Discipline: McDonald Principle (Anti-Repetition)

**CRITICAL RULE:** Once a character trait, wardrobe style, or location is established, DO NOT re-describe it in subsequent scenes.

**Established = Trust Reader's Memory:**
- **Abby's style:** Established as elevated, designer casual. Do NOT describe her outfit every appearance. "Abby stood at the stove" is sufficient.
- **Palmer kitchen:** Established as white quartz, brushed nickel, modern/stylish. Do NOT re-describe. "Eddie's kitchen" is sufficient.
- **Doogan's Cougar:** Established as beat-up 1970 Mercury Cougar XR-7. Do NOT re-describe every time he drives it.
- **Character physical traits:** Established in first appearance. Do NOT repeat in every scene.

**When to re-describe:**
- First appearance in a NEW episode (brief reminder only)
- Character deliberately changes appearance (new outfit for specific purpose)
- Location detail becomes plot-relevant ("he noticed the knife block for the first time")
- Callback/contrast serves emotional purpose

**Default mode:** Lean prose. Character walks into kitchen = just say they walked into kitchen.

**Why this matters:**
- McDonald style = authorial invisibility, dialogue-driven
- Over-description slows pacing and violates "show once, trust reader" principle
- Readers remember established details—repetition insults their intelligence
- More description ≠ better writing; precision and economy = better writing

## Police Procedures (Pacific Point PD)

### Arrest & Interrogation Protocol
- **Holding Cells:** No furniture. Suspects wait standing or sitting on floor. Used for temporary detention before processing or interrogation.
- **Interview/Interrogation Rooms:** Separate rooms with table, chairs, one-way mirror. This is where actual questioning occurs.
- **Procedure:** Detectives retrieve suspect from holding cell → walk to interview room → conduct interrogation.
- **Continuity Note:** Martinez and Finch follow standard procedure when questioning Doogan about Annabelle's murder (Episode 2, Scene 1).

### Annabelle's Death Investigation (Episode 2, Scene 1)
- **Farmer's Market:** Downtown, on Sixth Street. This is where Doogan first met Annabelle's dog (white poodle) on Saturday morning. *(Episode 1, Scene 6)*
- **Gelson's Grocery Store:** Where Doogan "coincidentally" ran into Annabelle again for the produce section meeting. *(Episode 1, Scene 8)*
- **Wine Count:** One bottle of Woodmark Vineyards wine consumed at dinner (custom label, white), approximately one glass and a half each. A second sealed bottle with same label visible in crime scene photos but never opened. *(Episode 1, Scene 9)*
- **Interrogation Dynamics:** Martinez leads with patient, conversational tone; Finch provides sharp, accusatory counterpoint. Classic good cop/bad cop but more naturalistic.
- **Doogan's One Phone Call:** After interrogation ends (when Martinez says "You've got a lawyer"), Doogan is allowed his one phone call. He calls Eddie at 3 AM. Eddie immediately Googles criminal defense attorneys and calls the first one who answers (Hank Stillman). Baxter runs a quick background check to verify Hank passed the bar. Eddie and Hank drive to the station to meet Doogan. *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*

### Hank Stillman (Criminal Defense Attorney)
- **Physical Description:** Heavyset man in an ill-fitting taupe suit and worn black shoes, sweating even in the early morning. Posture of someone who bills by the quarter hour. *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*
- **Personality:** "Parking meter with a law degree" - transactional, money-focused, not reassuring. Matter-of-fact rather than comforting. *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*
- **First Meeting:** Eddie found Hank via Google search at 3 AM - he was the first criminal defense attorney who answered the phone. No prior relationship with Eddie or Doogan. *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*
- **Verification:** Baxter ran quick background check confirming Hank passed the bar (barely, from what Baxter found). *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*
- **Retainer:** $15,000 for initial filings, arraignment if needed, and preliminary hearings. Trial costs more. Payment required within 48 hours. *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*
- **Legal Advice:** Don't talk to anyone about the case, don't leave Los Angeles County, don't do anything stupid (going near victim's apartment, trying to investigate alone). *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*
- **Status:** Bottom-tier lawyer, but he showed up at 3 AM and knows criminal defense procedure. Eddie doesn't love paying $15k but they have it as long as Doogan keeps working. *(Episode 2, Scene 2)*

## Communications Technology
- **Doogan's Covert Earpiece:** Doogan wears a nearly invisible, military-grade communications device sourced by Baxter through questionably legal channels (gray-market intelligence equipment dealers found on encrypted forums). Comparable to CIA/Secret Service equipment. Flesh-toned, uses bone conduction technology, practically undetectable even at close range. Doogan wears it almost constantly—only removes it when sleeping, showering, or during intimate moments. This allows Baxter (and the team) to maintain near-constant communication during operations, providing real-time intel, warnings, and coordination. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 2)*
- **Episode 2 Confiscation:** When Doogan was arrested and booked for Annabelle's murder, Pacific Point PD confiscated all personal items including his nearly-invisible earpiece. The booking officers catalogued it as "unidentified electronic device" without realizing its true function. After his release in Scene 2, Doogan no longer has the earpiece. Baxter must provide a replacement ASAP before the wedding job begins. *(Episode 2, Scenes 1-3)*
- **Martinez Questions the Earpiece (Future Scene):** Martinez eventually confronts Doogan about the confiscated earpiece: "So, what's this? Even the IT nerds at the station don't recognize it." Doogan claims Baxter got it from some edgy Japanese tech company. Martinez doesn't buy it entirely but can't prove otherwise—and doesn't return it yet. This creates ongoing tension about the device's discovery. *(Setup in Episode 2, Scene 3; payoff TBD)*
- **Replacement Logistics:** Baxter keeps backup earpieces (expensive but necessary for the business). Eddie picks up Baxter (whose car is still parked near Gelson's from when the Annabelle situation started), they retrieve Doogan's Cougar, and Baxter delivers the replacement earpiece to Doogan's condo. *(Episode 2, Scene 3)*
- **Doogan's Car Location:** Doogan's Cougar was left parked near Gelson's grocery store Monday night when he went to meet Annabelle for dinner. He rode to her apartment with her and was arrested from there—never returned to his car. Eddie and Baxter retrieve it for him. *(Episode 2, Scene 3)*
- **Operational Implications:** Unless explicitly stated otherwise, assume the team has audio access to Doogan during operations. Baxter can feed him background information, Eddie can provide tactical advice, and Abby can intervene if things go sideways. The device's invisibility is crucial—targets never realize Doogan is receiving external guidance.
- **Comedy/Tension Potential:** The earpiece creates opportunities for the team to overhear private moments, for device malfunctions at critical times, for discovery threats, and for Doogan having to maintain composure while receiving unexpected information.

## Doogan's Condo (Seduction Headquarters)
- **Location:** High up in a luxury building in Pacific Point's urban high-rise district—more urban than Eddie/Abby's upscale suburbs
- **Living Space:** Immaculate, perfectly decorated with modern urban aesthetic—muted tones, charcoal sectional positioned for view, exposed brick, dark elegance, low coffee table with fresh flowers (regularly swapped out), tv remote and hardback novel, nothing accidental. Not cluttered, just enough to be interesting but nothing too personal, too messy. Feels like a stage set.
- **Windows:** Floor-to-ceiling with panoramic city skyline views
- **Kitchen:** Chef-grade paradise designed for seduction—soapstone countertop veined in dark simplicity, custom walnut cabinetry, commercial six-burner range with griddle, Sub-Zero fridge, German steel knives, copper pots hanging by size
- **Purpose:** This is where Doogan feels most in control; the kitchen is his real superpower for dates—cooking for women in his territory
- **Contrast:** Perfect-but-empty living space vs. kitchen designed for intimacy
- **Inspiration:** Hitch (Will Smith)—bachelor pad ready for seduction
- *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*

## Baxter's Digital Operations
- **Social Media Management:** Baxter creates and maintains carefully crafted social media profiles for Doogan (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) with curated photos (cooking, sailing, lifestyle shots), believable posts, and strategic details. Updates twice weekly to keep algorithms happy and maintain authenticity. Designed to pass background checks and look genuine. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*
- **Transaction History Surveillance:** Baxter can pull credit card/bank transaction histories through gray-area hacking methods. Used to identify patterns (shopping times, favorite locations, spending habits). *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*
- **Effectiveness Evidence:** Annabelle Anders viewed Doogan's Instagram profile four times since their first meeting, scrolled through photos, and read comments on two posts—showing particular interest in the cooking and sailing pics. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 7)*

## The Wine Connection
- The "Woodmark Vineyards" wine that Annabelle got from a client recently is the same "Woodmark" wine that Nurse Nancy happens to have and Doogan is blacked out both times from it
- Eventually, it is confirmed that the drug in the wine is a new variation of Nexapan, a sedative that is specifically intended for oral use and alcohol actually increases its rate of absorbtion
- Doogan remembers the wine label on both bottles and that is the clue that Baxter uses to track down his real identity
- But there's no way that they could have gotten drug into the wine because in both cases, the wine bottles were sealed, with a wrapper on top which would have made syringe delivery of drugs impossible.
- Turns out "Woodmark Vineyards" is also a scam.  Its cheap, dollar store white wine, relabeled by a different con artist who has a connection to John Wipple, who coincidentally looks just like Albert Stans.
- The fake wine scam actually uses boxed wine and fills wine bottles and a custom label.  In fact, that's how the scam first started.  It was a way for sleazy men to buy wine laced in the Rohypnol.

## The Murder Frame-Up Mechanics (Episode 1)
- **Critical Phone Call:** In Scene 8 (Tomato Aisle), Doogan calls Eddie to report "I'm meeting her tonight" at the grocery store. This is ESSENTIAL—Eddie relays this timeline to Sebastian, who needs to know when Doogan will be in Annabelle's apartment so he can send someone to kill her and frame Doogan. Without this call, the murder setup doesn't work. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 8)*
- **The Drugged Wine:** The Woodmark Vineyards wine Annabelle serves is pre-drugged with Nexapan. Both Doogan and Annabelle drink it throughout the cooking/flirting scene. The drug takes 20-30 minutes to take full effect. They progressively get woozy, disoriented, lose coordination. Doogan blacks out BEFORE any sexual activity occurs (maintaining his innocence/the frame-up). Someone enters the apartment while both are unconscious and kills Annabelle, leaving Doogan beside her body. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 9)*
- **Timeline Coordination:** Sebastian needs the specific timing to coordinate the killer's entry. The phone call in Scene 8 provides this. The killer waits for the drug to take effect (approximately 30-40 minutes after dinner starts) before entering.

## Detective Partner
- When Doogan is first questioned by Martinez, he has Detective Finch with him
- But the next time Doogan sees him, he asks Martinez where his partner is
- Martinez chuckles and explains that the buddy cop thing is only for movies and tv shows and that in real life there is a primary investigator and then homicide works in small teams so sometimes there is a detective with him and sometimes there isn't
- This continues when Martinez is questioning Doogan later and has a different detective with him

## Martinez Surveillance Limitations (CRITICAL STORY MECHANISM)
**RULE:** Baxter CANNOT track Martinez's car or movements via GPS/hacking.

**Why This Matters:**
- Martinez must be able to appear unexpectedly to question Doogan/Eddie
- Unexpected confrontations create dramatic tension and force characters to think on their feet
- If Martinez is trackable, the team always has warning and tension evaporates
- Martinez's surprise appearances are a key storytelling mechanism throughout the series

**What Baxter CAN Do:**
- Monitor police dispatch channels (but Martinez doesn't always call things in)
- Research Martinez's past cases and patterns
- Track police activity generally
- Hack databases Martinez uses (carefully, leaving no trace)

**What Baxter CANNOT Do:**
- Track Martinez's personal vehicle via GPS
- Predict when Martinez will show up at locations
- Know Martinez's schedule or movements in advance

**Exception:** If Martinez is tailing someone in an obvious police vehicle with active radio communication, Baxter might catch those transmissions. But Martinez's personal movements remain unknown.

*(Established as hard rule in Episode 2, Scene 7 rewrite - December 27, 2025)*

## Nurse Nancy Character Moments
- At one point, Doogan meets Nurse Nancy for a walk around the park and she brings her dog, who poops while they're walking.  Nancy casually pulls out a poop bag, picks up the poop but as two people are pushing a stroller the other direction she tosses it into the stroller without even breaking looking or breaking her thought while talking.  Doogan of course runs back to fetch the bag, with the people outraged.

## Holding Cell Graffiti
- The first time Doogan is in the holding cell he sees "Julio (heart) Dominique".
- The second time he's in that same holding cell after Nurse Nancy's death the name "Dominique" is crossed out with thin carved lines from something sharp and the words "cheating whore" are written over it.  Doogan thinks "hmmm...that's too bad.  Poor Julio.
- The third time he's in that same holding cell after being arrested by Martinez, the "cheating whore" is scratched out and Dominique's name is back, larger and more emphasized.  "Got to love a happy ending".

## Episode 2 Wedding Weekend Continuity

### Rehearsal Dinner & Surveillance (Episode 2, Scene 14)
- **Doogan's Father's Rules Applied:** When picking up Cheryl, Doogan follows Rule #1 (get out of car, go to door) and opens passenger door for her—demonstrating these rules are active habit, not just backstory
- **Cheryl's House:** Nice two-story, perfectly landscaped, expensive neighborhood—but not ostentatious. Modern professional aesthetic reflecting her corporate finance career. *(Established in Episode 2, Scene 14)*
- **Cougar Moment:** Cheryl falls in love with Doogan's beat-up 1970 Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible—sees it as perfectly him and perfectly Southern California. Perfect convertible weather for drive. This creates genuine romantic moment before surveillance intrusion.
- **Brad/Gabby Reveal:** Cheryl discloses she dumped Brad first (six months dating), Gabby swooped in three months later and got engaged. Cheryl is self-aware: "Gabby wouldn't see it that way, though." This is the real reason Sylvia hired Doogan—containment, not just distraction.
- **Unknown Sedan:** After dropping Cheryl home, Doogan spots a sedan that followed them from rehearsal dinner location. He guesses it's connected to people trying to frame him for Annabelle's murder (NOT Martinez at this point—unknown surveillance). This is why he declines Cheryl's implicit invitation to extend the evening.
- **Cheryl's Line:** "I'd go just about anywhere with you, Doogan...as long as it's in this car." Shows genuine connection before surveillance costs them the moment.
- **Timeline Setup:** Scene 15 (The One-Way Street Trap) happens AFTER Doogan leaves Cheryl's house—Doogan is being followed and calls Eddie/Baxter for help. Baxter suggests trap using one-way street downtown. When follower approaches, Doogan discovers it's Martinez (not the bad guys). Martinez confronts him about team investigating clinic. *(Established in Episode 2, Scene 14-15)*
