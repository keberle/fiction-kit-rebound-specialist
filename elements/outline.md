# Story Outline: The Rebound Specialist 

## Episode 1: The Receptionist
<!-- Reference: outlines/episode-01.md -->
### Summary
This is the initial episode of this series and story.  It establishes Doogan, Eddie, Abby and Baxter but it also establishes the nature of their business and their friendship.  It opens with a prologue showing a successful conclusion to a rebound job and then an oddly suspicious next job that ends in a cliffhanger.  Eddie has a new client, Sebastian who is the CEO of a medical billing company and has been seeing his receptionist but needs to end things and doesn't want it to be messy, impacting his company culture.  So he hires Eddie and Doogan to rebound his receptionist, Annabelle.  And Doogan works his magic and ends up making dinner for Annabelle and things are going great until he is woken up by police in bed next to her dead body.

## Episode 2: The Wedding Weekend
<!-- Reference: outlines/episode-02.md -->
### Summary
The episode opens with Doogan in a holding cell and gives us more character development for Detective Martinez, one of our antagonists.  And now that they had to come up with a lawyer and bail money, they need a job and they need it badly.  So while the team helps to investigate the Receptionist job, Doogan has to go to work and babysit the maid of honor at a wedding weekend, that will be full of some surprises and a happy ending.  The episode ends with some breaks in the case but an indicator that something much bigger is going on here.

## Episode 3: The Professional Golfer
<!-- Reference: outlines/episode-03.md -->
### Summary
The team is working to find more details but Doogan is on overload now that it looks like the murder he's being framed for is part of something bigger so its convenient that Eddie has an excuse for him to leave town for a few days, despite Martinez explictly telling him not to leave town.  Doogan serves as caddy for an older female professional golfer (Mara) who has gotten into her head too much, making it difficult to attract product endorsement deals.  Her manager is hiring Doogan to serve as her caddy and love interest during a weekend Pro Am (professional + amateur) golf tournament where whe will be paired with a celebrity amateur golfer and the sponsors will be watching so its an opportunity to take an aging golfer, taking her career comeback too seriously and show her lighter, funnier side.  Meanwhile the team is getting more information and with Abby's help, finds out more about one of the receptionist's co-workers but she's a real handful.  Doogan's next rebound is found but he's not going to find this one so easy.

### Notes
- Mara is paired with a comedic actress who isn't a golfer but took some lessons. (ugh)
- The format of this Pro Am tournament is a scramble on Friday, where the field of 80 pairs is cut down to 40.  Then its a best ball tournament with the same pairings where the field is once again cut down to 20.  The finals are done with the top 20 pairs dividing up with the celebrities playing each other and the pros playing each other.  The combined scores determine the winner of the tournament.
- While Mara has been teamed with a trainwreck of a celebrity, she plays great but more importantly, despite not loving the pairing at first, she ends up bonding with the actress and their chemistry is really what appeals to the advertisers and not the chemistry with Doogan.
- Doogan uses some obscure PGA tournament memories from Eddie along with a weather report from Baxter to spot a way for Mara to win the pro tournament on the last day against her rival, Cherry.

## Episode 4: Nurse Nancy
<!-- Reference: outlines/episode-04.md -->

### Summary
The team tracks down Nancy, a nurse at the suspicious clinic, but she's obnoxious, unethical, and a real handful. Doogan meets her at an upscale brunch spot where he witnesses her complete lack of ethics (swapping champagne bottles, later throwing dog poop in a baby stroller). Despite her awful personality, Doogan uses his professional skills to get close to her. During a dog walk, Nancy casually admits the clinic's prescription fraud scheme—nurses forge prescriptions and use a pharmacy that doesn't care if signatures match.

Meanwhile, Martinez inadvertently gives the team a new lead when he asks about Dr. Feldman, who's been missing. The team divides efforts: Eddie investigates the clinic and doctor's house, discovering Feldman hasn't been there in months and the house is packed up for fleeing. Criminal surveillance (Frank Charles with a mugshot) watches the house. Eddie eventually confronts Dr. Feldman, who reveals he was coerced by a criminal organization that now controls his clinic—he's just a signature. Patient files disappear and people he's never met end up dead.

The team attempts a clinic break-in while Doogan distracts Nancy at dinner, but an alarm goes off. Doogan has to drive Nancy to the clinic and sacrifices himself (nurse uniform gambit) to get Eddie and Baxter out safely. Meanwhile, the pharmacy investigation reveals a sweet family business, not criminals—they're unwitting participants.

The episode climaxes when Doogan cooks dinner for Nancy at his condo. She brings a bottle of white wine as a gift—Woodmark Vineyards. Both drink, Doogan blacks out, and wakes to Martinez's tap on his forehead: "We really should stop meeting this way, Mr. Andrews." Nancy is dead beside him. History repeats—Doogan framed for a second murder. The organization is eliminating loose ends while framing Doogan.

## Episode 5: The War of the Roses

## Summary
This scene opens with Doogan in the same holding cell for the second time and once again Detective Martinez and Detective Finch come to question him.  This time Martinez has brought a lab tech with him to draw some blood from Doogan.  And once again Eddie gets his shady lawyer to get him out.  But now they really need money so Doogan has to take a job right away that he might normally refuse.  While Doogan is busy, the team gets a break on the pharmacy.  The older couple who own it are a dead end but there's a young pharmacy tech that they are thinking might be the one person in the business with a clue but how do they get to her?  She's too young for Doogan to not look like a creep picking up on her so its time to bring in Baxter, who is terrifed at the prospect.  Baxter's edge, he will have Eddie and Doogan in his year (and Abby) to help him out.  Baxter ends up asking Ellie (pharmacy tech) out on a date and this will actually be Baxter's first date.  During the date, still getting the Cyrano treatment from the gang, he finds out that the pharmacy is issuing prescriptions for one name that are picked up by another a lot but her grandmother says that happens sometimes.  Ellie things its happening a lot.  One thing is for sure, the pharmacy is not part of some deeper conspiracy and definitely didn't kill either the receptionist or Nurse Nancy to cover anything up.  This starts to feel like a dead end when Ellie mentions that all of the prescriptions with one name on the prescription and a different name picking it up from the clinic all have the same insurance carrier...Theta Health.

## Episode 6: The Divorce

## Summary
Baxter digs through the patient files he copied off of the clinic patient software before it vanished and does find that all of the patients that Nurse Nancy was seeing had their bills covered by Theta Health as well.  This might be the team's first real lead.  But attempts to get in the door at the Theta Health offices are a dead and so they head back to the clinic.  Time to question the doctor, who apparently has already been questioned by the cops a couple of times.  Martinez finds Doogan and Eddie as they leave the clinic and starts questioning them about what they're doing...again.  Doogan asks about the blood test and Martinez tells him this isn't a cop show and lab results take time, especially if they don't know what they're looking for or if there is anything at all.

Meanwhile, the mounting legal fees has Doogan taking another rebound he would rather miss.  A man about to go through divorce mediation wants his wife to find a love interest to soften her a bit so she doesn't destroy him with divorce terms.  Doogan hates these types of rebounds but they pay the bills.  But as Doogan gets to know her, the husband is increasingly pressing him to move things forward and it triggers Doogan's suspicious nature about their clients.  In the end, it turns out that the husband was hoping that Doogan would sleep with the wife, which would trigger the cheating clause in their prenup.  Doogan puts it together just in time and outs the man but now there's now way he will pay them, increasing the financial pressure on the business.

### Episode Arc

## Episode 7: The Funeral Rebound

Abby gets Doogan to take on the strangest rebound yet.  He is supposed to go to the funeral of a woman who had body image issues her whole life and was very self conscious about her appearance and the fact that she never married or had kids.  Doogan is supposed to attend the funeral and the wake after and pretend to be her secret lover, so her friends think she was secretly a real catch.  This will be the strangest rebound he has ever taken on.

Meanwhile, the team needs to get in the door of Theta Insurance and Abby relucantly agrees to pose as an investor since they may recognize Doogan and Eddie.  She chats up another investor but they're strangely guarded.  Meanwhile, Baxter is still trying to dig up more information about the insurance company.  Abby finally meets the CEO and snaps his photo and she says that he looks really familiar but she can't figure out why, Eddie and Baxter recognize him immediately.  Its Sebastian, who hired them for the receptionist job but he looks wildly different and goes by a different name, Albert Stans.  Abby eventually is able to snag pictures of some investor files but they need to connect those to prescriptions.  Baxer needs to go back undercover.

## Episode 8: The Merger Rebound

After the last two rebounds, the team needs a more lucrative option and he finds one with a board of directors that wants Doogan to distract a workaholic female CEO during a tense merger.  Its been years since her divorce and in that time, her tireless work to make the company profitable has been appreciated but now there is an interested buyer and the board wants to cash out but the CEO isn't sure.  They want Doogan to soften her up so she's less laser focused on work and perhaps more open to the merger.

Meanwhile, Baxter has to go back undercover to get information from Ellie, the pharmacist's granddaughter.  But with Doogan busy with the rebound, Eddie is in his ear helping and their attempts at subeterfuge are not going well and Baxter finally just breaks and tells her everything, with Eddie freaking out in his ear not to do that.  Oddly enough, she totally gets it and wants to help.  Her gandparents would not have done anything like that knowingly.  She ends up giving them access to the files they need, so now they have the investor list.  Martinez shows up at a tennis club where Doogan has been trying to get the CEO to try something other than work (Baxter digs up that she played tennis in college) and questions Doogan more and lets it slip that the doctor has vanished.  Now they need one of the investors to agree to testify or this thing won't work.  But why would people testify about their own shady business deal, possibly getting themselves into trouble?

## Episode 9: The Big Break

The rush is on to find an investor.  With the help of the pharmacy files, Baxter is able to connect the dots a lot better.  But why would an insurance fraud scam kill two people?  Baxter tracks down the cagey investor that Abby was chatting up in the lobby of the insurance company and he frequents a sports bar in the valley.  Eddie heads there to see if he can chat him up since he's already seen Abby and at this point Martinez is following Doogan more and more.  Meanwhile, Abby still doesn't understand how they kept drugging Doogan and the girls and she ambushes Martinez for a change.  She catches Martinez coming out of the accounting office the doctor used, where he's been following the money.  She questions him about Doogan's blood test.  Turns out that he had Nexapan, an oral sedative, in his system the second time they arrested him and they found traces in both Nurse Nancy and Annabelle's blood work.  She points out that its kind of hard to kill someone when you're unconscious.  Martinez doesn't respond.  She calls Baxter after she's done questioning Martinez and has him investigating how they could have put Nexapan into Doogan's system.  Several drinks in and Eddie has managed to ingratiate himself with the investor and is playing pool while chatting about investments with him when he slips and mentions the insurance thing.  Eddie is careful but asks for some light details such as the downside.  The investor says the downside is that you have no idea how much the damn investment will cost.  Eddie is confused because insurance premiums are set, right?  But the investor tells him that you have to cover medications and other medical bills so that the life insurance carrier doesn't figure out how sick they are and the bills are not small. Eddie calls the team from his car while driving back to Pacific Point to meet up and they're all on the call trying to put pieces together with everything they've learned.  Eddie points out that Sebastian's first fake business when he hired them for the receptionist rebound was a medical billing company.  That gives them the missing piece and makes the money start to click in place.  But all they have right now, is an insurance and medical fraud.  How do they connect that to two murders and get Doogan off the hook?  Just then Doogan can be heard acknowledging Detective Martinez and a back up detective.  They're placing him under arrest...again.  When Doogan starts mentioning how he couldn't have killed those women while drugged, Martinez agrees.  He's not arresting him for murder this time.  He's arresting him for solicitation and fraud.

## Episode 10: Finale

The scene opens up with Doogan in that same holding cell again.  Now the "cheating whore" below Dominique's name is crossed out and Dominique's name written much larger.  At least Julio got a happy ending.  Martinez shows up but this time alone to question Doogan and he has much more specific information about Doogan's business.  Eddie and the lawyer are going to be able to get him out but he's due back the next day do meet with the DA who will lay out the charges in detail.  The team now has a deadline.

Doogan finally remembers the wine, Woodmark Vineyards.  But when Baxter tries to find it, its not a real winery.  At least not one with any real location.  In fact, you can't even buy it anywhere that he can find.  But there's something about printing fake wine labels that triggers something for Abby.  There's a documentary about that and its not as easy to fake wine as it looks.  That leads Baxter and Abby in the direction of finding the source of the wine.  Meanwhile, Eddie and Doogan are strategizing about how they can get the investor from the sports bar to testify about the scam but they need enough proof to trigger him to turn, possibly risking himself since he was part of an insurance fraud but if they're right that the medical billing is also a scam, he's probably out a lot of money to the scammers and that pride is almost as strong a motivator as money.

Abby finally remembers where she saw the CEO before and she puts on the documentary about wine labels.  He was part of the scam to make fake high end wine labels and bottles and scam rich people and she shows a scene from the documentary where its clearly Sebastian LeClere/Albert Sans but he's in the background of the guy who they really ended up putting away.  The documentary is a few years old though and Baxter confirms that he's out on parole at this point.  But anyone on parole has to check in with a parole officer, so Baxter is able to get access to the records (because, who with any sense would want to hack the department of corrections?) and they have a current address for the wine label forger and Eddie and Baxter head over to investigate.

Meanwhile, Abby and Eddie go to talk to the investor to see if he'll go to the feds and turn in the insurance scam.  Nothing seems to work until explain that the medical billing company has also been scamming him.  Then he's furious and agrees turn over what he's got to the feds.

It turns out the label forger is back at it but not for a high end wine scam.  Instead, he's taking cheap boxed wine, infusing it with Rohypnol and packaging it up in mass purchased wine bottles with fake labels for sleazy guys who produce a fully in tact, sealed wine bottle and don't have to try to drug their dates in the glass.  So horrible!  But he did do a special small batch with Nexapan, but it has to be blended just right so that it doesn't settle in the box wine and he's really proud of himself.  Clearly Curtis (wine label forger) is mentally deficient and morally empty.  Doogan switches gears and pretends to be a buyer and he's ready to place an order for a special batch for his needs but Curtis says that his partner makes all the deals.  Doogan asks him to take him to his partmer so they can make the deal and the three head to the partner's office.

Baxter gets a message to Eddie and Abby that they should follow his location with their phones and head to the wine boss's office.  They arrive with the investor in tow, who's angry.  The place Curtis has taken them to is the medical billing office, where Curtis heads to Sebastian LeClere's office.  As soon as Sebastian sees Curtis with Doogan he knows something is up and pretends not to know who Curtis is or what he's asking about.  Curtis keeps calling him John.  About that time Abby and Eddie show up with the investor and just as the investor pulls out a gun to shoot Sebastian/Albert/John or whatever the hell his name is, Martinez shows up out of nowhwere again with multiple detectives and they arrest the scammers, the wine forger and the investor.  The gang tries to explain what was up but Martinez just smiles and explains that they've all been under surveillance and had a wire on them this whole time so they know everything.  Eddie looks at Baxter and says "you're fire" and Abby then says "no you're not".  The scene ends with Martinez looking at Doogan and saying "and I'll see you in the courthouse tomorrow, the DA will decide if we go forward with other charges."

The final scene is the DA's office.  Martinez and Finch are there along with Doogan and his attorney, in an office waiting for the lawyer from the DA's office.  In walks Claire Rogers.  Doogan is both happy to see her but also terrified that she's seen the charges and knows that she was a rebound.  After some back and forth, Claire informs them that the DA's office sees nothing but a time suck of a case with at best circumstantial evidence and a nothing sentence at the end of it.  On the way out of the office, Doogan gets a minute or two quietly with Claire where she asks "who hired you for me?" and Doogan says that it wasn't for a bad reason at all.  Someone was just worried about her but he's not going to say because he's still a professional.  She smiles, "this was your one get out of jail free card, Doogan.  Stay off the radar."  Doogan smiles and leaves.  Out in front of the courthouse is Eddie, Abby and Baxter parkes on the side of the street in front of the courthouse.  Eddie is driving with Abby and Baxter in the back as Doogan heads for the empty passenger seat.  And Eddie throws out one last "can we please go trade this thing in?" and Doogan just smiles and says "not a chance."  The four pull away.  End.
