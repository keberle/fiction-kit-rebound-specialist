# Tone & Mood: The Rebound Specialist

## Overview

This combined guide defines the story's tonal and mood signatures: quick, clever, and consistently funny—anchored by Doogan’s sharp, adaptive humor—and a mood that’s breezy, slightly dark, and satirical. Tone and mood work together to keep scenes fast, witty, and emotionally resonant without lingering in sentimentality.

*For every scene, aim for a mood that’s fast, funny, and just a little bit dark—where heartbreak is just another setup for a great punchline.*

*Aim for scenes that are entertaining, witty, and occasionally unexpected—where heartbreak becomes fodder for a sharp joke and the reader is always two steps behind Doogan’s next quip.*
