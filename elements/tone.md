## Scene Tone Checklist

Before finalizing any scene:

1. **Humor earned?** Setup exists in scene/character
2. **Stakes maintained?** Comedy doesn't undercut danger
3. **Voices distinct?** Each character sounds like themselves
4. **Tone appropriate?** Matches scene purpose in outline
5. **McDonald invisibility?** Author absent from page
