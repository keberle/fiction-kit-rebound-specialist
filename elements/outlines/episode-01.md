# Episode Outline
---
**Title:** The Receptionist
**Episode:** 1
**Theme:** Doogan’s strange little business works—until it doesn’t.
**Summary:** Doogan executes a clean “rebound” breakup, gets handed a new client (Sebastian LeClere) and a new target (Annabelle Anders), and clocks that the story they’re being sold doesn’t match the woman he meets. He gets in anyway. He wakes up with a badge in his face and a dead woman beside him.
**Hook / Cold Open:** A breakup that feels weirdly… successful.
**End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Doogan wakes up in a fog; Annabelle is dead.**Setting Notes:** All scenes follow Southern California cultural norms (see `elements/setting.md`): car culture dominates, rideshare (Uber/Lyft) is standard, valet parking common at nice venues, no one hails taxis, locals use "the" before freeway numbers.---

## **1. Prologue — “The Dumping”**
Purpose:
Introduce Doogan’s job, charm, and the show’s moral premise—in one clean scene.

Beats:
- Restaurant. Claire “dumps” Doogan with no hard feelings—almost gratitude.
- Doogan keeps it light, flirty, and attentive; he’s better at this than he should be.
- Claire has bought into his cover that he's a consultant; she can’t know the truth.
- Subtle hints Claire is a lawyer / government-adjacent, nothing direct.

Turn:
The breakup lands *too* well. Doogan took the job; he also caught feelings.

Button:
Doogan clocks the waiter’s "check?" gesture and playfully redirects—exit on a joke.

---

## **2. Valet — Sweet Goodbye**
Purpose:
Show Doogan's exit ritual (valet → Cougar), his small decency, and Eddie's "handler" energy. This is also a chance to show that Doogan has some ethics, despite the unethical nature of his business. **Establishes Doogan's military-grade covert earpiece that he wears almost constantly.**

Beats:
- Walk-and-talk to valet. Doogan tips, opens doors, says goodbye like it matters.
- Nearby: a young couple implodes; the woman storms off.
- Doogan to the young man: "The trick is knowing when to follow and when not to follow." (This is a follow-her moment.)
- The 1970 Mercury Cougar convertible arrives—battered, beloved.
- **Earpiece introduction:** Reveal Doogan's nearly invisible, CIA-level communications device (Baxter sourced it through questionably legal channels). Establish that Doogan wears it almost constantly—team can reach him anytime except when sleeping, showering, or intimate. Uses bone conduction, virtually undetectable.
- In-car call: Eddie checks in through the earpiece. Dinner invite; Doogan initially declines.
- Eddie pitches two jobs; Doogan rejects both.
- Eddie mentions there's a third job—rich guy, office situation, usual thing—wants to discuss in person (not seeking Abby's input—she'll give it anyway).
- Eddie bribes with Thai food (ordering takeout).
- Doogan accepts the dinner invitation.

Turn:
Doogan tries to come down from the job; Eddie pulls him back in—but this time with an in-person meeting.

Button:
Doogan heading to Eddie and Abby's place. "Which meant Abby would be there. Which meant she'd give us her take on it whether we wanted it or not. That usually meant trouble." **Earpiece stays in—always connected.**

---

## **3. Eddie & Abby's Kitchen — The New Client Briefing**
Purpose:
First in-person introduction to Eddie and Abby, establish trio dynamic, tee up the Sebastian job.

How it plays:
- Doogan arrives at Eddie and Abby's place (their home).
- Scene set in their kitchen over Thai food.
- First time audience meets Eddie and Abby in person.
- Eddie briefs the Sebastian LeClere case: wealthy client, receptionist situation, wants clean break.
- Doogan asks questions; Eddie provides details: Annabelle Anders, late twenties, Sebastian says she's pulling away.
- Doogan's skeptical—something feels off about taking the job.
- Abby teases both of them about the ethics of the business.
- Abby points out they always meet these sketchy clients at obscure coffee places like Duke's Coffee.
- Eddie confirms the meeting: tomorrow, Duke's Coffee, 10 AM, business casual.
- Cougar joke/comment from Abby or Eddie.
- Doogan reluctantly agrees to at least hear Sebastian out.

Turn:
Doogan agrees to meet the client—reluctantly.

Button:
Abby's sharp observation about their "sketchy client protocol" lands. Sets up Scene 4 (morning run).

This scene tells the audience:
**The trio's dynamics—Eddie the salesman, Doogan the reluctant artist, Abby the sharp conscience. Also establishes the Sebastian job details that were withheld in Scene 2.**

Notes:
- This is where all the Sebastian/Annabelle details get revealed
- Abby's presence adds moral weight and comedy
- Kitchen setting makes it domestic, intimate—contrasts with the sleazy work
- Three-way banter should feel lived-in, comfortable
- Scene must not repeat beats from Scene 2—it's the REVEAL of job details, not a summary

---

## **4. Morning Run — Baxter in the Ear**
Purpose:  
Introduce Baxter, his dynamic with Doogan, and deliver backstory through dialogue. Also: locate Annabelle for the meet-cute. **Demonstrates the earpiece in operational use.**

How it plays:  
- Doogan's morning run through the neighborhood. **Earpiece active—Baxter on comms (established in Scene 2).**
- Baxter on comms: enthusiastic, a little starstruck, rapid-fire intel delivery.
- Baxter is running searches on Annabelle Anders—she's weirdly hard to pin down online.
- Doogan asks clarifying questions; Baxter bounces between browser tabs and databases.
- **Baxter**: "How did you and Eddie even do this before the internet?"
- **Doogan** (laughing): "Very differently. Want to hear about the first job?"
- Doogan tells the story while running:
  - College. VP of the fraternity. Secret engagement. Sister sorority hookup.
  - Eddie pitched it as a "business opportunity." Doogan thought he was insane.
  - They needed the money. Doogan agreed.
  - It worked—flawlessly. The girl was *grateful*.
  - Eddie immediately wanted to make it a regular thing. Doogan said no.
  - Cut to: them doing it full-time after graduation.power
- Baxter is fascinated, asks follow-up questions about technique.
- Doogan deflects with humor: "The trick is not thinking about it too hard."
- **Baxter** (suddenly excited): "Oh! Got something. I posed as a cosmetic company rep—got added to her Snapchat."
- Annabelle shares her location; Instagram shows she frequents a specific spot.
- And she has a white teacup poodle dog.  "Of course."
- **Baxter**: "Farmer's Market. Saturday mornings. She posts from there constantly."
- Doogan clocks the intel as he approaches the coffeehouse for the client meet.

This scene tells the audience:  
**Baxter idolizes Doogan, the business has comedic-cynical origins, and the team's research methods bend rules.**

Notes:  
- This scene should feel like a Sorkin single shot dialog sequence from shows like West Wing and Studio 60 but with Doogan running and Baxter talking in his ear instead.
- Keep Baxter earnest and tech-focused; he's the kid who wants to impress the legend.
- The first job story should feel like a fond memory with an edge of "we probably shouldn't have done that."
- Doogan arrives at the coffeehouse as the scene ends, transitioning smoothly into the client meet.

## **5. Coffeehouse Meet — "Sebastian LeClere"**
Purpose:  
Introduce the villain persona and give Doogan his first "something's off" moment.

How it plays:  
- Doogan arrives in running gear at Duke's Coffee.
- Eddie and Sebastian are already at a table—Eddie waves him over.
- Eddie comments on the lack of business casual
- Doogan points out that his car is at home at least but then clarifies that the running gear is cover for a "chance" bump-in later.
- Sebastian is impressed… but doesn't know basic details about his own receptionist.
- Sebastian is too polished. Too rehearsed. Doogan feels it and hates that he can't name it.
- Sebastian says he isn't married; he just can't have office mess.
- Eddie plays the reasonable salesman; Doogan plays the skeptical conscience.
- Doogan exits: "I'm going to be late for my meet-cute." Snags bacon from Sebastian's untouched plate.
- Eddie reassures Sebastian: professional, clean, done.


This scene tells the audience:  
**Doogan’s instincts are sharp, even when he can’t explain them.**

Notes:
- Keep it brief. The longer it runs, the more Doogan would press—and the more Sebastian would have to slip.

---

## **6. Farmer's Market — Doogan Charms Annabelle**
Purpose:  
Show Doogan in his element—banter as foreplay, charm as a skill.

How it plays:  
- Annabelle’s small dog is immediately obsessed with Doogan (bacon in the pocket). She’s embarrassed; he makes it a bit.
- Banter lands fast. Annabelle is sharp; Doogan keeps up.
- Doogan flirts—and then leaves first. On purpose.
- Later: they “accidentally” run into each other again at produce (Doogan taking tomatoes seriously).
- Baxter in Doogan’s ear can’t understand why he didn’t ask her out.

This scene tells the audience:  
**Doogan’s superpower is social intelligence.**

Note:
- Doogan has to be almost accidentally charming in this scene.  He's great with women but being too polished with a young woman like this can actually backfire on him.
- Keep him playful, not predatory; he lets her curiosity do the work.

---

## **7. The Meet Cute Debrief — Looking for more background information** 
Purpose:  
Let Doogan articulate the mismatch: Sebastian's story doesn't fit Annabelle.  It just doesn't fit.

How it plays:
- Doogan has just come from the farmer's market and goes to see Eddie and ask why there's so little background work yet.
- Doogan explains the encounter.
- Eddie dismisses his concerns.  
- Abby sides with Doogan — something is off.
- Baxter is on a facetime call on a tablet in the room and is digging around looking for more.
- Quick check: her social media doesn't read "recent breakup." No obvious purge.
- Eddie pushes Baxter to bend rules for deeper intel; Baxter produces basic transaction patterns.
- Doogan spots a trend but plays it light—he doesn't tip his whole hand.
- Abby rolls her eyes and says "if the women knew about you bunch of stalkers, you'd all be in jail"


This scene tells the audience:  
**Doogan’s intuition is real, even when others doubt him.**

Note: 
- Doogan doesn't love what he has to do sometimes but he's good at it.
- Eddie has no qualms about Baxter pushing legal limits but Doogan isn't a fan and Baxter is sometimes caught between them
- Abby loves her husband Eddie and his partner Doogan but she thinks their business is ridiculous...ridiculous but interesting

---

## **8. Coincidence #2 — The Tomato Aisle**
Purpose:  
Build chemistry and tension.  Annabelle is a little put off by Doogan's sudden appearance but he was there before she mentally dismisses that he is following her and she does like the idea of having someone to banter with again and it helps that he's good looking.

How it plays:  
- Doogan is pretending to compare tomatoes.  
- Annabelle is surprised to see him.  
- Their banter is sharper, flirtier, more charged.  
- He looks in her cart and sees trendy, premade meals (probably endorsed by some influencer)
- She challenges him on his cooking claims.
- He asks her a handful of questions about favorite restaurants and immediately guesses her favorite food: Shrimp Risotto.
- In Doogan's earpiece, Baxter says "there's no way she invites you back to her place to cook...NO WAY".  To which Doogan very subtly whispers back "...only if its her idea."
- How did he do that?  How did he guess her favorite dish? She is impressed with that skill.
- But he does point out how the grocery store has all of the needed ingredients, as long as you look past the influencer aisle.
- He buys the ingredients anyway and they continue chatting as they walk out.
- He offers to carry her grocery bag to her car for her but she informs him that her condo is just across the street and down a bit.  Convenient.
- She coyly wants to know if making that dish takes anything special and Doogan says the minimum cooking utesils and it takes minutes.
- She invites him back to her place.
- In his earpiece, Doogan hears Baxter in his ear saying "What?  How?  That doesn't happent to ANYONE else!"

This scene tells the audience:  
**Annabelle is warming to him and he's just intriguing enough to trust him to cook for her.**

Notes: 
- For this to work, she has to not dive in too fast.  Its a little weird that Doogan is at her market but he's pretty cute so she dismisses that and chats anyway.
- She is even less likely to invite a guy she just met back to her place but she overrides her tendancies and does this anyway.  This can't feel too natural for her or it will play badly.

## **9. Dinner at Annabelle's**
Purpose:
Pay off the charm run with a hard tonal snap: Doogan’s life changes in one cut.

Beats:
- Annabelle ushers him in; quick tidy (the place is “camera ready”).
- Doogan works with what her kitchen has; he can cook anywhere.
- Wine: a bottle from a client (Woodmark Vineyards, Napa). Doogan doesn’t recognize it.
- Toast, banter, heat. Annabelle makes the first move.
- Blackout.
- Foggy wake-up. A man taps his forehead—badge flashes.
- The detective gestures. Doogan turns: Annabelle dead in the bed beside him.

Button:
“Hands where I can see them.” Cut.
