# Episode Outline
---
**Title:** The Wedding Weekend
**Episode:** 2
**Theme:** Doogan juggling chaos — he’s trying to do a rebound job while a murder accusation shadows him.
**Summary:** Doogan gets hauled through a holding-cell interrogation, “lawyers up” without knowing he even has a lawyer, and gets shoved right back into work: a wealthy couple hires him to keep their older daughter (the maid of honor) from detonating a wedding weekend. The scavenger hunt becomes an obstacle course in loafers—made worse by a rival bridesmaid (Jillian) and her worthless boyfriend tailing them and then cheating to the finish. Intercut: Eddie, Abby, and Baxter chase Annabelle’s real employment trail to a strip-mall clinic that won’t cooperate socially or physically… until Abby gets one key data point. Baxter finally gets into the clinic system—and watches a file Annabelle flagged delete itself in real time.
**Hook / Cold Open:** Doogan in a holding cell, reading unhinged wall graffiti, while Martinez and Finch lean on him.
**End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Baxter opens Annabelle’s flagged file — it vanishes while they watch; someone else is logged in deleting records.

## Episode Arc
- Act 1 (setup): Holding cell interrogation → unexpected lawyer → the “we still have a job” problem.
- Act 2 (complication): Wedding weekend begins; Cheryl proves to be a handful; Eddie/Baxter push into clinic leads.
- Act 3 (payoff/turn): Rehearsal dinner reveal + reception success → clinic system breach → file deletes itself.

---

## **1. Cold Open — “Holding Cell Graffiti”**
Purpose:
Put Doogan under pressure immediately; establish Martinez/Finch; keep it dry and absurd.

Beats:
- Doogan clocks graffiti: “Julio ♥ Dominique.” Nice of him to declare that but how was she supposed to see it...in here?
- Martinez leads; Finch spikes the conversation with sharper, uglier insinuations.
- How did Doogan know Annabelle? Doogan stays on the grocery-store story and gives them nothing to hold.
- Martinez drops “she was strangled” like it’s a verdict; Finch drags it into something cruder.

Turn:
A knock. Whispered sidebar. Martinez ends it: Doogan “lawyered up.”

Button:
Finch: “The guilty ones always have lawyers.” Hard cut.

Notes: 
This is our first real chance to meet Martinez so this scene needs to show how his personality differs from Doogan.  He has a very dry wit but he's not outwardly funny or charming.  He married his high school girlfriend and he has no clue about the world Doogan works in.  Martinez just wants to solve crimes and in his head, he knows that a real killer wouldn't have stuck around all night to be caught but making people feel like they are a suspect tends to get them to be more forthcoming, even if its only to save their own butts.

## **2. The Walkout — “Your Lawyer’s Here”**
Purpose:
Get Doogan out; show the cost of help.

Beats:
- Eddie is there. Hank Stillman is there. Hank talks like a parking meter with a law degree.
- Hank’s rules: don’t leave town, don’t talk, don’t get cute with cops.
- Hank mentions money too many times for a man who just met you in a jail hallway.

Button:
Eddie: Abby’s making pancakes. (It’s comfort, and it’s also: we need you functional.)

---

## **3. Eddie’s Kitchen — “Pancakes and Employment”**
Purpose:
Reset the trio dynamic and throw Doogan back to work.

Beats:
- Abby needles Doogan about being arrested—softened by the fact it’s not actually funny.
- Eddie: Hank costs money; money means jobs.
- New client: Thomas and Sylvia Billings. Ask: keep their older daughter (Cheryl, maid of honor) from detonating a wedding weekend.

Button:
Abby: “And showered wouldn’t hurt.” Doogan goes to change like it’s a mission.

---

## **4. Restaurant Meeting — “Thomas, Not Tom”**
Purpose:
Introduce the Billings, set the weekend itinerary, and define the job’s cover-story shape.

How it plays:
- Eddie and Doogan meet Tom and Sylvia Billings at a restaurant in Pacific Point.
- Tom corrects them: “Thomas.” They clock what kind of wealthy man he is immediately.
- The Billings describe Cheryl as a “handful” and want her contained for “the social wedding of the season.”
- They don’t fully explain the real emotional landmine with the groom; Doogan fills in an obvious assumption and they don’t contradict him.
- They lay out the start of the weekend: a Saturday morning scavenger hunt that begins at their country club; their wedding planner Terry will meet Doogan there.
- Sylvia adds the scavenger hunt should be so much fun as she designed it herself.
- Scene ends on the plan — no travel beats here.

Turn:
Doogan realizes they’re not saying the real reason out loud—and that’s the real reason.

Button:
Saturday morning scavenger hunt at the country club. Terry will meet him there.

---

## **5. Country Club Kickoff — “Meet Terry. Meet Trouble.”**
Purpose:
Pair Doogan with Cheryl; launch the hunt; seed the rival.

Beats:
- Terry appears: flamboyant, hyper-competent, doesn’t know what Doogan really does—only that he’s “damage control.”
- Terry introduces Doogan to Cheryl. Cheryl is competitive like it’s a religion.
- The rules land: first prize is a designer handbag. Second prize is embarrassment.
- The hunt is literature-coded (Sylvia’s master’s degree). Doogan realizes he’s not just running; he’s taking a pop quiz.
- They’re handed the first clue *right away*.
- "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;" and Cheryl has no idea but Baxter has an idea and finds that it's Sonnet 130 by Shakespeare and there's some clues in the rest of the sonnet but the roses are on two lines and there's a flower shop named "The Rose Shop" a few blocks away.

Turn:
Doogan taps his ear: “On second thought, I’m going to need help.”

Button:
They jog out—Baxter feeds the location—while Jillian (a bridesmaid) and her worthless boyfriend clock them and follow.

---

## **6. Strip Mall Clinic — “Are You on a Stakeout?”**
Purpose:
Advance the Annabelle mystery thread and put Eddie into Doogan’s world of awkward cover stories.

How it plays:
- This happens right after Doogan meets Cheryl — the episode cuts away to the team’s parallel problem.
- Eddie sits outside a strip-mall clinic on a bench, on the phone with Baxter.
- Baxter is confident this clinic is Annabelle’s real employer (pulled from tax prep records).
- Eddie doesn’t understand why a different company hired them if she worked here.
- Martinez appears and clocks Eddie immediately: “Funny thing — if I didn’t know better, I’d say you were on a stakeout.”
- Eddie scrambles to cover; Martinez reveals they’re there because yes, Annabelle worked here, and it’s sketchy.
- Martinez heads inside to ask questions.
- Eddie retreats to his car and complains to Baxter: he could’ve warned him Martinez was right there.

This scene tells the audience:
**The investigation is moving in public now — Eddie can’t hide in the margins.**

Notes:
- Keep this tense-comedic: Eddie’s panic, Martinez’s dry authority.

---



## **7. Scavenger Hunt Stop — “The Flower Shop”**
Purpose:
Keep the hunt moving, establish Jillian shadowing, and let Cheryl notice the threat.

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl hit the flower shop (they already have the clue; Baxter has already given Doogan the location).
- They work the line out in front of the clerk—fast, competitive, funny.
- Jillian and her worthless boyfriend creep in and eavesdrop.
- Cheryl notices them and clocks what they’re doing.
- Cheryl orders red roses and they just bring them roses so that's not it.
- Baxter is reading the sonnet in Doogan's ear and comes to "I have seen roses damasked, red and white,"
- Doogan orders a mix of red and white roses; the clerk smiles and hands them the next clue.
- The next clue reads: “It’s not a crime to kill a mockingbird, but it might be a sin.”
- Baxter recognizes the reference immediately; Doogan recognizes what the clue *wants*: a place that’s wearing the reference like a hat.
- Baxter finds it: a pub nearby with the right kind of name.

Turn:
Cheryl decides they’re not just trying to win—they’re trying to *crush*.

Button:
They head for the pub—Jillian and her boyfriend still tailing.


---
## **8. Eddie’s House — “Not on the Sign Out Front”**
Purpose:
Bridge into the clinic-infiltration plan, show Baxter’s limitations in the physical world, and let Abby be the pragmatic instigator.

How it plays:
- Eddie is home, still keyed up, on a FaceTime call with Baxter.
- Baxter is explaining (too earnestly, too technically) that he can’t “hack a clinic” in a vacuum.
- Baxter’s point, translated: clinics don’t post their IT inventory on a sign out front.
- Eddie pushes for magic; Baxter pushes back: he needs software names, vendor clues, *anything*.
- Abby walks in mid-complaint, hears “inventory” and “clinic,” and immediately understands the real problem.
- Abby suggests the simplest solution in the world: Baxter should impersonate an IT tech and go look.
- Abby takes a jab at Baxter’s whole vibe (stereotypical nerd, allergic to eye contact) and Baxter bristles—then admits she’s right.
- Abby agrees to help him fake an IT uniform (shirt/badge/lanyard) just enough to get him past a tired front desk.

Turn:
Abby supplies the plan: stop trying to hack a mystery box; go get the software name.

Button:
Baxter, in an “IT uniform,” is an idea everyone agrees to regret later.

---


## **9. Scavenger Hunt Run — “Pub to Bookstore”**
Purpose:
Bring back the missing middle of the hunt (pub → used bookstore) and make the Gatsby path come from the clerk—while Jillian keeps shadowing.

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl hit the pub from the Mockingbird clue; Jillian and her worthless boyfriend drift in after them like they own the air.
- They solve the pub’s “trigger” quickly (right order / right phrase / right ask)—enough to get the next clue card.
- The next clue is Pride and Prejudice-coded.
- They sprint to a used bookstore and run into the new problem: a wall of Pride and Prejudice copies and no obvious instruction.
- Cheryl wants to brute-force it. Doogan decides to ask a human.
- Doogan asks the clerk. The clerk deadpans: they don’t want Pride and Prejudice—probably something by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
- Jillian and boyfriend are close enough to hear and immediately perk up.
- Baxter connects the pivot: Gatsby. There’s a speakeasy nearby.

Button:
Doogan and Cheryl move for the Gatsby speakeasy—knowing they’re being copied in real time.

---

## **10. Clinic Attempt — “Baxter, IT (For Thirty Seconds)”**
Purpose:
Intercut the A-plot with the clinic thread; give Baxter a funny, consequential fail.

Beats:
- Baxter shows up in Abby’s improvised “IT uniform,” armed with jargon and fear.
- The temp receptionist waves him back… then staff clock him instantly.
- He gets politely escorted out before he sees anything useful.

Button:
Eddie: “That went great if the goal was humiliation.”

---
## **11. Scavenger Hunt Stop — “The Great Gatsby Speakeasy”**
Purpose:
Pay off the shadowing and convert a “fun” scene into a precision test.

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl arrive. Jillian and boyfriend stay close enough to smell the punchlines.
- The bartender, smooth as a bribe: “Can I offer you some champagne?”
- Baxter in Doogan’s ear: Jay Gatsby didn’t drink alcohol.
- Doogan declines the champagne.
- The bartender smiles like this is the first honest thing he’s heard all day—and hands them the golden ticket.

Turn:
They solved it… but they solved it out loud.

Button:
Jillian and boyfriend jump in an Uber to cheat back to the country club.

---


## **12. Clinic Montage — “No. No. Cats.”**
Purpose:
Compress the clinic failures into one escalating sequence that stays funny.

Beats:
- Eddie tries the clean route: new patient, harmless questions, charm. The temp receptionist shuts everything down.
- Eddie tries the sneaky route: coordinated distraction + quick photo of the monitor.
- The photo is useless: the monitor is playing cat videos.
- Baxter takes personal offense at cat videos like it’s a moral betrayal.

Button:
Eddie: “Okay. Abby goes in.”

---
## **13. Finish Line — “Quid Agis?”**
Purpose:
Make the win condition a trap; pay off Baxter’s usefulness; infuriate the cheaters.

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl arrive back at the country club. Jillian and boyfriend are already there—smug, stumped.
- The golden ticket has “Quid agis?” on the back. Doogan clocks it’s Latin… and then: nothing.
- Terry (wedding planner) asks the finish-line question like it’s casual: “Are you done?”
- Cheryl is about to answer with something profane and victorious.
- Doogan stops her. “It’s a trick.”
- Doogan needles Sylvia for more context: not her degree—her childhood.
- Sylvia mentions her mom reading Harry Potter to her and her sister.
- Baxter, in Doogan’s ear, finally connects it: the password / the painting / the phrase.
- Terry asks again. Doogan answers: “Not until the fat lady sings.”

Turn:
They win.

Button:
Jillian is furious. Doogan carries a flashy new golf driver. Cheryl, clutching the high-end handbag, says she could use a ride to the rehearsal dinner.

---
## **14. Clinic Attempt (Success) — “Abby and the Temp”**
Purpose:
Pay off the clinic-access escalation: Abby walks in calm, gets the software name, and proves she’s the adult in the room.

How it plays:
- Abby goes into the clinic alone, no theatrics.
- She makes the temp receptionist laugh inside thirty seconds—small talk that feels effortless.
- Abby uses a simple pretext (billing question, prescription question, “I was told to ask the front desk”) and lets the temp do what bored temps do: overshare and swivel the monitor.
- Abby clocks the clinic’s software name on the screen — exactly what Baxter needs.
- Abby asks, casually, when the regular receptionist is back.
- The temp gives a vague answer that reveals she’s been kept in the dark.
- Abby leaves like she’s just run an errand, then immediately texts/calls the software name to the guys.

This scene tells the audience:
**Abby is quietly the most effective operator in the room.**

Notes:
- Keep it quick; no heroics.
- Abby shouldn’t sound like a spy—she should sound like a competent person.

---

## **15. Eddie and Baxter — “Cross a Few Lines”**
Purpose:
Raise the investigative stakes and define the moral friction: Eddie will push; Baxter will hesitate.

How it plays:
- Coming off Abby’s win, Eddie is energized: they finally have the software name.
- Baxter is less excited than he should be—because now it’s possible.
- Eddie pushes: with Doogan under suspicion, they can’t wait for subpoenas and polite requests.
- Baxter resists on principle and fear; Doogan hates when Baxter crosses lines.
- Eddie frames it bluntly: unless they want Doogan in prison for life, “clean” isn’t an option.
- Scene ends with Baxter agreeing, reluctantly, and setting a boundary that Eddie immediately tries to negotiate.

This scene tells the audience:
**Eddie will break the rules to save his friend — and Baxter is about to, too.**

Notes:
- Keep it short and sharp — a pivot scene.

---


## **16. Rehearsal Dinner — “The Real Reason”**
Purpose:
Reveal the true wedding landmine and let Doogan do the job at a higher emotional level.

Beats:
- Doogan ends up seated with Cheryl; she’s warmed up now.
- Reveal: Cheryl didn’t get dumped—she dumped Brad. Gabby swooped in and now she’s marrying him.
- Doogan realizes what he’s really being paid for: not distraction, containment.
- He keeps Cheryl buoyant through dinner without breaking the Secrecy Rule.
- He takes her home and she's about to invite him in when he spots Martinez in a car, clearly following him and doing surveillance

Button:
Doogan waves to Martinez on his way back to his car.  Martinez smiles and waves back.

---

## **17. Martinez Ambush - "Are your friends investigating the clinic?"**
Purpose:
Establish the dynamic between Doogan and Martinez.

Beats:
- 
- Arriving at home, Martinez parks and approaches Doogan
- "Are your friends investigating the clinic?" Martinez asks about Eddie and has pictures of Baxter and Abby going into the clinic
- "Are you following us?" Doogan asks.  "Yeah, that's how investigations work" Martinez replies.
- Martininez suggests letting the real cops do the work.
- Doogan notices Detective Finch isn't there this time and asks where his partner is and Martinez just dismisses the question with "what is it with you and your friends and buddy cop movies"
- But Martinez does admit to Doogan that things don't add up with Annabelle's murder but that doesn't mean Doogan isn't still the prime suspect

Button:
Martinez: "I am going to have more questions for you.  Don't leave town."

---

## **18. Reception — “Toast From Hell (Defused)”**
Purpose:
Deliver the rebound-job climax and show Doogan successfully steering chaos.

How it plays:
- Ceremony went fine; now it’s the reception.
- Terry and his assistant scramble with last-minute problems.
- Cheryl is drinking hard; Doogan keeps “losing” her drink whenever he can.
- Cheryl threatens a catastrophic toast; Doogan talks her off the ledge.
- Payoff: Cheryl gives the sweetest toast she’s capable of — it lands.
- Button: Cheryl grabs Doogan and pulls him out, promising the hotel room.

This scene tells the audience:
**Doogan can keep someone from detonating their own life — and sometimes that’s the whole job.**

Notes:
- Keep it funny and fast; don’t turn it sentimental.

---

## **19. Final Scene — “The File That Vanished”**
Purpose:
Close with the mystery hook: Annabelle flagged something real, and someone is actively erasing the evidence.

How it plays:
- Eddie and Abby are in their living room; Baxter is with them on a laptop.
- Baxter finally gets into the clinic’s medical software; he’s frustrated, then triumphant.
- He finds a file Annabelle flagged on her last day.
- Annabelle’s note reads: “Something isn’t right about this. Need to double check.”
- As Baxter starts reading, the file disappears in real time.
- Baxter checks active sessions: someone else is on the system right now deleting files.

This scene tells the audience:
**Annabelle wasn’t the story — what she found is.**

Notes:
- Doogan is not present in this scene.
