# Episode Outline
---
**Title:** The Wedding Weekend
**Episode:** 2
**Theme:** Doogan juggling chaos — he's trying to do a rebound job while a murder accusation shadows him.
**Summary:** Doogan gets hauled through a holding-cell interrogation, "lawyers up" without knowing he even has a lawyer, and gets shoved right back into work: a wealthy couple hires him to keep their older daughter (the maid of honor) from detonating a wedding weekend. The scavenger hunt becomes an obstacle course in loafers—made worse by a rival bridesmaid (Jillian) and her worthless boyfriend tailing them and then cheating to the finish. Intercut: Eddie, Abby, and Baxter chase Annabelle's real employment trail to a strip-mall clinic that won't cooperate socially or physically… until Abby gets one key data point. Baxter finally gets into the clinic system—and watches a file Annabelle flagged delete itself in real time.
**Hook / Cold Open:** Doogan in a holding cell, reading unhinged wall graffiti, while Martinez and Finch lean on him.
**End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Baxter opens Annabelle's flagged file — it vanishes while they watch; someone else is logged in deleting records.
**Structure:** 19 scenes (REORGANIZED to alternate between rebound job and clinic investigation timelines for better pacing and passage of time)
---

## Episode Arc
- Act 1 (setup): Holding cell interrogation → unexpected lawyer → the "we still have a job" problem → Doogan home to reset.
- Act 2 (complication): Wedding weekend begins; Cheryl's wounded pride bleeds through competitive drive; Eddie/Baxter push into clinic leads. **Timelines alternate throughout for pacing and passage of time.**
- Act 3 (payoff/turn): Rehearsal dinner reveal + Martinez surveillance (costs Doogan the Cheryl connection) + reception success → clinic system breach → file deletes itself.

---

## **1. Cold Open — "Holding Cell Graffiti"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Put Doogan under pressure immediately; establish Martinez/Finch; keep it dry and absurd.

**Sensory/Emotional Notes:**
- Physical: holding cell has no furniture, standing against wall, smell of industrial cleaner and stale urine
- Emotional: bone-tired, adrenaline crash from Annabelle's murder ~2 hours ago
- Gallows humor as defense mechanism against exhaustion and fear
- Transition: Martinez and Finch move him from holding cell to interview room (scarred table, chairs, one-way mirror)

Beats:
- Doogan in holding cell (no furniture), clocks graffiti: "Julio ♥ Dominique." Nice of him to declare that but how was she supposed to see it...in here?
- Martinez and Finch arrive, walk him to interview room
- Interview room interrogation: Martinez leads; Finch spikes the conversation with sharper, uglier insinuations.
- How did Doogan know Annabelle? Doogan stays on the grocery-store story and gives them nothing to hold.
- Martinez drops "she was strangled" like it's a verdict; Finch drags it into something cruder.

Turn:
A knock. Whispered sidebar. Martinez ends it: Doogan "lawyered up."

Button:
Finch: "The guilty ones always have lawyers." Hard cut.

Notes: 
This is our first real chance to meet Martinez so this scene needs to show how his personality differs from Doogan.  He has a very dry wit but he's not outwardly funny or charming.  He married his high school girlfriend and he has no clue about the world Doogan works in.  Martinez just wants to solve crimes and in his head, he knows that a real killer wouldn't have stuck around all night to be caught but making people feel like they are a suspect tends to get them to be more forthcoming, even if its only to save their own butts.

## **2. The Walkout — "Your Lawyer's Here"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Get Doogan out; show the cost of help.

Beats:
- Eddie is there. Hank Stillman is there. Hank talks like a parking meter with a law degree.
- Hank's rules: don't leave town, don't talk, don't get cute with cops.
- Hank mentions money too many times for a man who just met you in a jail hallway.

Button:
Eddie: Abby's making pancakes. (It's comfort, and it's also: we need you functional.)

---

## **3. Eddie's Kitchen — "Pancakes and Employment"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Reset the trio dynamic and throw Doogan back to work.

**Eddie's Voice (Motor-Mouth Example):**
"—so Hank costs money, obviously, guy's a lawyer even if he's a bottom-tier one, and lawyers don't work for free or friendship or any of the things normal humans accept, which means we need money, which means you need to work, which I know sounds insane considering you were literally arrested last night but guess what, the Billings still want their wedding weekend handled—"

**Emotional Notes:**
- Abby's pancakes = comfort; Doogan barely tastes them (still processing trauma)
- Doogan uses work as distraction from murder accusation

Beats:
- Abby needles Doogan about being arrested—softened by the fact it's not actually funny.
- Eddie steamrolls: Hank costs money; money means jobs.
- We will focus on finding out about Annabelle and Sebastian; you make sure we keep this next client happy. We need the money.
- New client: Thomas and Sylvia Billings. Ask: keep their older daughter (Cheryl, maid of honor) from detonating a wedding weekend.
- **CRITICAL LOGISTICS:** Eddie steps into kitchen for FaceTime call with Baxter (Doogan can overhear from dining area). Eddie: "They took his earpiece when they booked him—need a replacement ASAP, he's got a job starting in a few hours." Baxter confirms he has a backup unit and will bring it over immediately. This establishes: (1) police confiscated the earpiece during booking, (2) Baxter keeps backups, (3) replacement will be delivered to Doogan's condo.

Button:
Eddie drops Doogan at his place. Abby: "And showered wouldn't hurt."

---

## **4. Doogan's Condo — "Back in Place"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Give Doogan a moment alone; deliver replacement earpiece; set up future Martinez earpiece confrontation.

**Emotional Notes:**
- Doogan alone in his staged, empty condo—stage set for a life he's not living
- Shower = trying to wash away interrogation room
- Internal realization: someone studied him, set him up perfectly

Beats:
- Doogan arrives at condo (exactly how he left it Monday evening—immaculate, staged, empty)
- Shower scene: internal processing, realization someone engineered this frame
- Sebastian isn't sophisticated enough—someone smarter is involved
- Baxter arrives with replacement earpiece; sound check confirms it's working
- Baxter warns: cops will examine the confiscated earpiece, IT won't recognize it
- Cover story established: "Japanese company, custom hearing assist device"
- Baxter: "I can create a paper trail if I need to." (Sets up future Martinez confrontation)
- Baxter leaves; Doogan alone with his thoughts
- Fitful sleep, dreams of interrogation rooms

Turn:
Doogan realizes he's not just a suspect—he's a *target*.

Button:
Tomorrow he works. Tonight, he tries to sleep.

---

## **5. Restaurant Meeting — "Thomas, Not Tom"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Introduce the Billings, set the weekend itinerary, and define the job's cover-story shape.

How it plays:
- Eddie and Doogan meet Tom and Sylvia Billings at a restaurant in Pacific Point.
- Tom corrects them: "Thomas." They clock what kind of wealthy man he is immediately.
- The Billings describe Cheryl as a "handful" and want her contained for "the social wedding of the season."
- They don't fully explain the real emotional landmine with the groom; Doogan fills in an obvious assumption and they don't contradict him.
- They lay out the start of the weekend: a Saturday morning scavenger hunt that begins at their country club; their wedding planner Terry will meet Doogan there.
- Sylvia adds the scavenger hunt should be so much fun as she designed it herself.
- Scene ends on the plan — no travel beats here.

Turn:
Doogan realizes they're not saying the real reason out loud—and that's the real reason.

Button:
Saturday morning scavenger hunt at the country club. Terry will meet him there.

---

## **6. Country Club Kickoff — "Meet Terry. Meet Trouble."**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Begins)

Purpose:
Pair Doogan with Cheryl; launch the hunt; seed the rival.

**Emotional Notes:**
- Doogan running on fumes, using the job as distraction from murder accusation
- Cheryl's competitiveness has an *edge*—she's proving something (hint at sister/wedding tension)

Beats:
- Terry appears: flamboyant, hyper-competent, doesn't know what Doogan really does—only that he's "damage control."
- Terry introduces Doogan to Cheryl. Cheryl is competitive like it's a religion.
- The rules land: first prize is a designer handbag. Second prize is embarrassment.
- The hunt is literature-coded (Sylvia's master's degree). Doogan realizes he's not just running; he's taking a pop quiz.
- They're handed the first clue *right away*.
- "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;" and Cheryl has no idea but Baxter has an idea and finds that it's Sonnet 130 by Shakespeare and there's some clues in the rest of the sonnet but the roses are on two lines and there's a flower shop named "The Rose Shop" a few blocks away.

Turn:
Doogan taps his ear: "On second thought, I'm going to need help."

Button:
They jog out—Baxter feeds the location—while Jillian (a bridesmaid) and her worthless boyfriend clock them and follow.

---

## **7. Strip Mall Clinic — "Are You on a Stakeout?"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Eddie/Baxter — Clinic Investigation Begins)

Purpose:
Advance the Annabelle mystery thread and put Eddie into Doogan's world of awkward cover stories.

How it plays:
- This happens right after Doogan meets Cheryl — the episode cuts away to the team's parallel problem.
- Eddie sits outside a strip-mall clinic on a bench, on the phone with Baxter.
- Baxter is confident this clinic is Annabelle's real employer (pulled from tax prep records).
- Eddie doesn't understand why a different company hired them if she worked here.
- Martinez appears and clocks Eddie immediately: "Funny thing — if I didn't know better, I'd say you were on a stakeout."
- Eddie scrambles to cover; Martinez reveals they're there because yes, Annabelle worked here, and it's sketchy.
- Martinez heads inside to ask questions.
- Eddie retreats to his car and complains to Baxter: he could've warned him Martinez was right there.

This scene tells the audience:
**The investigation is moving in public now — Eddie can't hide in the margins.**

Notes:
- Keep this tense-comedic: Eddie's panic, Martinez's dry authority.

---

## **8. Scavenger Hunt Stop — "The Flower Shop"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Continues)

Purpose:
Keep the hunt moving, establish Jillian shadowing, and let Cheryl notice the threat.

**Clue Mechanics (Specific):**
- Clerk asks: "Any color preference?"
- Doogan: "Red and white."
- Clerk smiles, reaches under counter, hands them sealed envelope with next clue

**Cheryl Emotional Throughline:**
- Sharp comment about "younger sisters" or weddings with an edge
- Doogan notices but doesn't press (too good for that)
- Her competitiveness isn't just fun—she's *proving* something

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl hit the flower shop (they already have the clue; Baxter has already given Doogan the location).
- They work the line out in front of the clerk—fast, competitive, funny.
- Jillian and her worthless boyfriend creep in and eavesdrop.
- Cheryl notices them and clocks what they're doing.
- Cheryl orders red roses and they just bring them roses so that's not it.
- Baxter is reading the sonnet in Doogan's ear and comes to "I have seen roses damasked, red and white,"
- Doogan orders a mix of red and white roses; the clerk smiles and hands them the next clue (envelope from under counter).
- The next clue is Pride and Prejudice-coded.
- Baxter finds a bookstore nearby.

Turn:
Cheryl decides they're not just trying to win—they're trying to *crush*.

Button:
They head for the bookstore—Jillian and her boyfriend still tailing.

---

## **9. Eddie's House — "Not on the Sign Out Front"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Eddie/Baxter/Abby — Planning Infiltration)

Purpose:
Bridge into the clinic-infiltration plan, show Baxter's limitations in the physical world, and let Abby be the pragmatic instigator.

How it plays:
- Eddie is home, still keyed up, on a FaceTime call with Baxter.
- Baxter is explaining (too earnestly, too technically) that he can't "hack a clinic" in a vacuum. That only happens in bad movies and tv shows.
- Baxter's point, translated: clinics don't post their IT inventory on a sign out front.
- Eddie pushes for magic; Baxter pushes back: he needs software names, vendor clues, *anything*.
- Abby walks in mid-complaint, hears "inventory" and "clinic," and immediately understands the real problem.
- Abby suggests the simplest solution in the world: Baxter should impersonate an IT tech and go look.
- Abby takes a jab at Baxter's whole vibe (stereotypical nerd, allergic to eye contact) and Baxter bristles—then admits she's right.
- Abby agrees to help him fake an IT uniform (shirt/badge/lanyard) just enough to get him past a tired front desk.

Turn:
Abby supplies the plan: stop trying to hack a mystery box; go get the software name.

Button:
Baxter, in an "IT uniform," is an idea everyone agrees to regret later.

---

## **10. Scavenger Hunt Run — "Bookstore to Speakeasy"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Accelerates)

Purpose:
Accelerate the hunt through multiple locations via summary, arrive at Prohibition Tacos with skepticism.

**Cheryl Emotional Throughline:**
- Competitive tension rising, another barbed comment
- Physical exhaustion showing through the comedy

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl hit the bookstore with the Pride & Prejudice clue.
- At the bookstore, they work through the clue and get directed to a travel agency.
- As they arrive at Prohibition Tacos, Doogan summarizes (to Cheryl or Baxter in his ear) the three prior stops:
  - Started at the bookstore with the P&P clue
  - That led them to a travel agency with a Jules Verne quote
  - The travel agency gave them a To Kill A Mockingbird line
- Baxter says the TKAM clue points to a place called Prohibition Tacos.
- Doogan says that doesn't make sense.
- Baxter insists they'll see when they get there.
- Cheryl isn't sure either—it's just a taco place?
- Jillian and her boyfriend are still shadowing them.

Button:
They arrive at a very small taco place with just a couple tables—this can't be right.

---

## **11. Clinic Montage — "No. No. Cats."**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Eddie/Baxter — Infiltration Attempts Fail)

Purpose:
Compress clinic infiltration failures into one escalating sequence that stays funny and builds to Abby.

**Sensory Notes:**
- Tension, frustration, boredom of stakeout/infiltration work
- Physical comedy of failures

Beats:
- Baxter shows up in Abby's improvised "IT uniform," armed with jargon and fear.
- The temp receptionist waves him back… then staff clock him instantly.
- He gets politely escorted out before he sees anything useful.
- Eddie tries the clean route: new patient, harmless questions, charm. The temp receptionist shuts everything down.
- Eddie tries the sneaky route: coordinated distraction + quick photo of the monitor.
- The photo is useless: the monitor is playing cat videos.
- Baxter takes personal offense at cat videos like it's a moral betrayal.

Button:
Eddie: "Okay. Abby goes in."

---

## **12. The Speakeasy Reveal — "Prohibition Speakeasy"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Turning Point)

Purpose:
Deliver the hidden bar reveal, show Doogan's literary knowledge impressing Cheryl, catch Jillian already there.

**Cheryl Emotional Throughline:**
- Starts to be genuinely impressed by Doogan (turning point in her warming to him)
- Competitive fire still present but respect building

**Clue Mechanics (Specific):**
- Ask clerk for "mockingbird tacos" to access hidden door
- Bartender offers champagne (test)
- Doogan declines because Atticus Finch didn't drink in the book
- Bartender slides them water with golden ticket on coaster

Beats:
- Prohibition Tacos looks like just a small taco place with a couple tables.
- Baxter says he found "it"—a Reddit post says to ask the clerk for mockingbird tacos.
- Doogan asks for mockingbird tacos; clerk gestures toward a hidden door in the back.
- They enter the Prohibition Speakeasy—a prohibition-era themed bar hidden behind the taco place.
- Jillian and her worthless boyfriend are already there with champagne flutes—how are they running that fast?
- But Jillian and boyfriend look lost, confused.
- Bartender approaches, offers Doogan and Cheryl champagne.
- Cheryl is about to accept (Jillian has champagne, must be right).
- Doogan notices the trick—declines. "We're not really drinkers."
- Bartender smiles, slides them a bottle of water.
- The coaster underneath is the golden ticket.
- As they leave, Cheryl asks: "So you don't drink?"
- Doogan: "Hell no. I drink a lot. Atticus Finch didn't drink in the book."
- Cheryl is impressed—this is where she starts warming to him.

Turn:
Doogan's literary knowledge wins the round and earns Cheryl's respect.

Button:
They have the golden ticket; Jillian is still stuck inside with her champagne.

---

## **13. Clinic Attempt (Success) — "Abby and the Temp"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Abby — Gets the Software Name)

Purpose:
Pay off the clinic-access escalation: Abby walks in calm, gets the software name, and proves she's the adult in the room.

How it plays:
- Abby goes into the clinic alone, no theatrics.
- She makes the temp receptionist laugh inside thirty seconds—small talk that feels effortless.
- Abby uses a simple pretext (billing question, prescription question, "I was told to ask the front desk") and lets the temp do what bored temps do: overshare and swivel the monitor.
- Abby clocks the clinic's software name on the screen — exactly what Baxter needs.
- Abby asks, casually, when the regular receptionist is back.
- The temp gives a vague answer that reveals she's been kept in the dark.
- Abby leaves like she's just run an errand, then immediately texts/calls the software name to the guys.

This scene tells the audience:
**Abby is quietly the most effective operator in the room.**

Notes:
- Keep it quick; no heroics.
- Abby shouldn't sound like a spy—she should sound like a competent person.

---

## **14. Finish Line — "Quid Agis?"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Victory)

Purpose:
Make the win condition a trap; pay off Baxter's usefulness; infuriate the cheaters.

**Cheryl Emotional Throughline:**
- Victory moment shows her competitive drive clearly masking something deeper
- Invitation to rehearsal dinner = trust building, but emotional guard still up

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl arrive back at the country club. Jillian and boyfriend are already there—smug, stumped.
- The golden ticket has "Quid agis?" on the back. Doogan clocks it's Latin… and then: nothing.
- Terry (wedding planner) asks the finish-line question like it's casual: "Are you done?"
- Cheryl is about to answer with something profane and victorious.
- Doogan stops her. "It's a trick."
- Doogan needles Sylvia for more context: not her degree—her childhood.
- Sylvia mentions her mom reading Harry Potter to her and her sister.
- Baxter, in Doogan's ear, finally connects it: the password / the painting / the phrase.
- Terry asks again. Doogan answers: "Not until the fat lady sings."

Turn:
They win.

Button:
Jillian is furious. Doogan carries a flashy new golf driver. Cheryl, clutching the high-end handbag, says she could use a ride to the rehearsal dinner.

---

## **15. Eddie and Baxter — "Cross a Few Lines"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Eddie/Baxter — Moral Choice)

Purpose:
Raise the investigative stakes and define the moral friction: Eddie will push; Baxter will hesitate.

**Eddie's Voice:**
- Motor-mouth steamrolling Baxter's objections
- Tangents circling back to "Doogan can't go to prison"

How it plays:
- Coming off Abby's win, Eddie is energized: they finally have the software name.
- Baxter is less excited than he should be—because now it's possible.
- Eddie pushes: with Doogan under suspicion, they can't wait for subpoenas and polite requests.
- Baxter resists on principle and fear; Doogan hates when Baxter crosses lines.
- Eddie frames it bluntly: unless they want Doogan in prison for life, "clean" isn't an option.
- Scene ends with Baxter agreeing, reluctantly, and setting a boundary that Eddie immediately tries to negotiate.

This scene tells the audience:
**Eddie will break the rules to save his friend — and Baxter is about to, too.**

Notes:
- Keep it short and sharp — a pivot scene.

---

## **16. Rehearsal Dinner — "The Real Reason"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Emotional Reveal)

Purpose:
Reveal the true wedding landmine and let Doogan do the job at a higher emotional level.

Beats:
- Doogan ends up seated with Cheryl; she's warmed up now.
- Reveal: Cheryl didn't get dumped—she dumped Brad. Gabby swooped in and now she's marrying him.
- Doogan realizes what he's really being paid for: not distraction, containment.
- He keeps Cheryl buoyant through dinner without breaking the Secrecy Rule.
- He takes her home and she's about to invite him in when he spots Martinez in a car, clearly following him and doing surveillance.

Button:
Doogan waves to Martinez on his way back to his car. Martinez smiles and waves back.

---

## **17. Martinez Ambush — "Are your friends investigating the clinic?"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Investigation Collision)

Purpose:
Establish the dynamic between Doogan and Martinez.

Beats:
- Arriving at home, Martinez parks and approaches Doogan.
- "Are your friends investigating the clinic?" Martinez asks about Eddie and has pictures of Baxter and Abby going into the clinic.
- "Are you following us?" Doogan asks. "Yeah, that's how investigations work" Martinez replies.
- Martinez suggests letting the real cops do the work.
- But Martinez does admit to Doogan that things don't add up with Annabelle's murder but that doesn't mean Doogan isn't still the prime suspect.

Button:
Martinez: "I am going to have more questions for you. Don't leave town."

---

## **18. Reception — "Toast From Hell (Defused)"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Success)

Purpose:
Deliver the rebound-job climax and show Doogan successfully steering chaos.

How it plays:
- Ceremony went fine; now it's the reception.
- Terry and his assistant scramble with last-minute problems.
- Cheryl is drinking hard; Doogan keeps "losing" her drink whenever he can.
- Cheryl threatens a catastrophic toast; Doogan talks her off the ledge.
- Payoff: Cheryl gives the sweetest toast she's capable of — it lands.
- Button: Cheryl grabs Doogan and pulls him out, promising the hotel room.

This scene tells the audience:
**Doogan can keep someone from detonating their own life — and sometimes that's the whole job.**

Notes:
- Keep it funny and fast; don't turn it sentimental.

---

## **19. Final Scene — "The File That Vanished"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Baxter/Eddie/Abby — Cliffhanger)

Purpose:
Close with the mystery hook: Annabelle flagged something real, and someone is actively erasing the evidence.

How it plays:
- Eddie and Abby are in their living room; Baxter is with them on a laptop.
- Baxter finally gets into the clinic's medical software; he's frustrated, then triumphant.
- He finds a file Annabelle flagged on her last day.
- Annabelle's note reads: "Something isn't right about this. Need to double check."
- As Baxter starts reading, the file disappears in real time.
- Baxter checks active sessions: someone else is on the system right now deleting files.

This scene tells the audience:
**Annabelle wasn't the story — what she found is.**

Notes:
- Doogan is not present in this scene.
