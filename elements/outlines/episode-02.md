# Episode Outline
---
**Title:** The Wedding Weekend
**Episode:** 2
**Theme:** Doogan juggling chaos — he's trying to do a rebound job while a murder accusation shadows him.
**Summary:** Doogan gets hauled through a holding-cell interrogation, "lawyers up" without knowing he even has a lawyer, and gets shoved right back into work: a wealthy couple hires him to keep their older daughter (the maid of honor) from detonating a wedding weekend. The scavenger hunt becomes an obstacle course in loafers—made worse by a rival bridesmaid (Jillian) and her worthless boyfriend tailing them and then cheating to the finish. Intercut: Eddie, Abby, and Baxter chase Annabelle's real employment trail to a strip-mall clinic that won't cooperate socially or physically… until Abby gets one key data point. Baxter finally gets into the clinic system—and watches a file Annabelle flagged delete itself in real time.
**Hook / Cold Open:** Doogan in a holding cell, reading unhinged wall graffiti, while Martinez and Finch lean on him.
**End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Baxter opens Annabelle's flagged file — it vanishes while they watch; someone else is logged in deleting records.
**Structure:** 17 scenes (REORGANIZED to alternate between rebound job and clinic investigation timelines for better pacing and passage of time)
---

## Episode Arc
- Act 1 (setup): Holding cell interrogation → unexpected lawyer → the "we still have a job" problem → Doogan home to reset.
- Act 2 (complication): Wedding weekend begins; Cheryl's wounded pride bleeds through competitive drive; Eddie/Baxter push into clinic leads. **Timelines alternate throughout for pacing and passage of time.**
- Act 3 (payoff/turn): Rehearsal dinner reveal + Martinez surveillance (costs Doogan the Cheryl connection) + reception success → clinic system breach → file deletes itself.

---

## **1. Cold Open — "Holding Cell Graffiti"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Put Doogan under pressure immediately; establish Martinez/Finch; keep it dry and absurd.

**Sensory/Emotional Notes:**
- Physical: holding cell has no furniture, standing against wall, smell of industrial cleaner and stale urine
- Emotional: bone-tired, adrenaline crash from Annabelle's murder ~2 hours ago
- Gallows humor as defense mechanism against exhaustion and fear
- Transition: Martinez and Finch move him from holding cell to interview room (scarred table, chairs, one-way mirror)

Beats:
- Doogan in holding cell (no furniture), clocks graffiti: "Julio ♥ Dominique." Nice of him to declare that but how was she supposed to see it...in here?
- Martinez and Finch arrive, walk him to interview room
- Interview room interrogation: Martinez leads; Finch spikes the conversation with sharper, uglier insinuations.
- How did Doogan know Annabelle? Doogan stays on the grocery-store story and gives them nothing to hold.
- Martinez drops "she was strangled" like it's a verdict; Finch drags it into something cruder.

Turn:
A knock. Whispered sidebar. Martinez ends it: Doogan "lawyered up."

Button:
Finch: "The guilty ones always have lawyers." Hard cut.

Notes: 
This is our first real chance to meet Martinez so this scene needs to show how his personality differs from Doogan.  He has a very dry wit but he's not outwardly funny or charming.  He married his high school girlfriend and he has no clue about the world Doogan works in.  Martinez just wants to solve crimes and in his head, he knows that a real killer wouldn't have stuck around all night to be caught but making people feel like they are a suspect tends to get them to be more forthcoming, even if its only to save their own butts.

## **2. The Walkout — "Your Lawyer's Here"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Get Doogan out; show the cost of help.

Beats:
- Eddie is there. Hank Stillman is there. Hank talks like a parking meter with a law degree.
- Hank's rules: don't leave town, don't talk, don't get cute with cops.
- Hank mentions money too many times for a man who just met you in a jail hallway.

Button:
Eddie: Abby's making pancakes. (It's comfort, and it's also: we need you functional.)

---

## **3. Eddie's Kitchen — "Pancakes and Employment"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Reset the trio dynamic and throw Doogan back to work.

**Eddie's Voice (Motor-Mouth Example):**
"—so Hank costs money, obviously, guy's a lawyer even if he's a bottom-tier one, and lawyers don't work for free or friendship or any of the things normal humans accept, which means we need money, which means you need to work, which I know sounds insane considering you were literally arrested last night but guess what, the Billings still want their wedding weekend handled—"

**Emotional Notes:**
- Abby's pancakes = comfort; Doogan barely tastes them (still processing trauma)
- Doogan uses work as distraction from murder accusation

Beats:
- Abby needles Doogan about being arrested—softened by the fact it's not actually funny.
- Eddie steamrolls: Hank costs money; money means jobs.
- We will focus on finding out about Annabelle and Sebastian; you make sure we keep this next client happy. We need the money.
- New client: Thomas and Sylvia Billings. Ask: keep their older daughter (Cheryl, maid of honor) from detonating a wedding weekend.
- **CRITICAL LOGISTICS:** Eddie steps into kitchen for FaceTime call with Baxter (Doogan can overhear from dining area). Eddie: "They took his earpiece when they booked him—need a replacement ASAP, he's got a job starting in a few hours." Baxter confirms he has a backup unit and will bring it over immediately. This establishes: (1) police confiscated the earpiece during booking, (2) Baxter keeps backups, (3) replacement will be delivered to Doogan's condo.

Button:
Eddie drops Doogan at his place. Abby: "And showered wouldn't hurt."

---

## **4. Doogan's Condo — "Back in Place"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Give Doogan a moment alone; deliver replacement earpiece; set up future Martinez earpiece confrontation.

**Emotional Notes:**
- Doogan alone in his staged, empty condo—stage set for a life he's not living
- Shower = trying to wash away interrogation room
- Internal realization: someone studied him, set him up perfectly

Beats:
- Doogan arrives at condo (exactly how he left it Monday evening—immaculate, staged, empty)
- Shower scene: internal processing, realization someone engineered this frame
- Sebastian isn't sophisticated enough—someone smarter is involved
- Baxter arrives with replacement earpiece; sound check confirms it's working
- Baxter warns: cops will examine the confiscated earpiece, IT won't recognize it
- Cover story established: "Japanese company, custom hearing assist device"
- Baxter: "I can create a paper trail if I need to." (Sets up future Martinez confrontation)
- Baxter leaves; Doogan alone with his thoughts
- Fitful sleep, dreams of interrogation rooms

Turn:
Doogan realizes he's not just a suspect—he's a *target*.

Button:
Tomorrow he works. Tonight, he tries to sleep.

---

## **5. Restaurant Meeting — "Thomas, Not Tom"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job Setup)

Purpose:
Introduce the Billings, set the weekend itinerary, and define the job's cover-story shape.

How it plays:
- Eddie and Doogan meet Tom and Sylvia Billings at a restaurant in Pacific Point.
- Tom corrects them: "Thomas." They clock what kind of wealthy man he is immediately.
- The Billings describe Cheryl as a "handful" and want her contained for "the social wedding of the season."
- They don't fully explain the real emotional landmine with the groom; Doogan fills in an obvious assumption and they don't contradict him.
- They lay out the start of the weekend: a Friday morning scavenger hunt that begins at their country club; their wedding planner Terry will meet Doogan there.
- Sylvia adds the scavenger hunt should be so much fun as she designed it herself.
- Scene ends on the plan — no travel beats here.

Turn:
Doogan realizes they're not saying the real reason out loud—and that's the real reason.

Button:
Friday morning scavenger hunt at the country club. Terry will meet him there.

---

## **6. Country Club Kickoff — "Meet Terry. Meet Trouble."**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Begins)

Purpose:
Pair Doogan with Cheryl; launch the hunt; seed the rival.

**Emotional Notes:**
- Doogan running on fumes, using the job as distraction from murder accusation
- Cheryl's competitiveness has an *edge*—she's proving something (hint at sister/wedding tension)

Beats:
- Terry appears: flamboyant, hyper-competent, doesn't know what Doogan really does—only that he's "damage control."
- Terry introduces Doogan to Cheryl. Cheryl is competitive like it's a religion.
- The rules land: first prize is a designer handbag. Second prize is embarrassment.
- The hunt is literature-coded (Sylvia's master's degree). Doogan realizes he's not just running; he's taking a pop quiz.
- They're handed the first clue *right away*.
- "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;" and Cheryl has no idea but Baxter has an idea and finds that it's Sonnet 130 by Shakespeare and there's some clues in the rest of the sonnet but the roses are on two lines and there's a flower shop named "The Rose Shop" a few blocks away.

Turn:
Doogan taps his ear: "On second thought, I'm going to need help."

Button:
They jog out—Baxter feeds the location—while Jillian (a bridesmaid) and her worthless boyfriend clock them and follow.

---

## **7. Strip Mall Clinic — "Are You on a Stakeout?"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Eddie/Baxter — Clinic Investigation Begins)

Purpose:
Advance the Annabelle mystery thread and put Eddie into Doogan's world of awkward cover stories.

How it plays:
- This happens right after Doogan meets Cheryl — the episode cuts away to the team's parallel problem.
- Eddie sits outside a strip-mall clinic on a bench, on the phone with Baxter.
- Baxter is confident this clinic is Annabelle's real employer (pulled from tax prep records).
- Eddie doesn't understand why a different company hired them if she worked here.
- Martinez appears and clocks Eddie immediately: "Funny thing — if I didn't know better, I'd say you were on a stakeout."
- Eddie scrambles to cover; Martinez reveals they're there because yes, Annabelle worked here, and it's sketchy.
- Martinez heads inside to ask questions.
- Eddie retreats to his car and complains to Baxter: he could've warned him Martinez was right there.

This scene tells the audience:
**The investigation is moving in public now — Eddie can't hide in the margins.**

Notes:
- Keep this tense-comedic: Eddie's panic, Martinez's dry authority.

---

## **8. Scavenger Hunt Stop — "The Flower Shop"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Continues)

Purpose:
Keep the hunt moving, establish Jillian shadowing, and let Cheryl notice the threat.

**Clue Mechanics (Specific):**
- Clerk asks: "Any color preference?"
- Doogan: "Red and white."
- Clerk smiles, reaches under counter, hands them sealed envelope with next clue

**Cheryl Emotional Throughline:**
- Sharp comment about "younger sisters" or weddings with an edge
- Doogan notices but doesn't press (too good for that)
- Her competitiveness isn't just fun—she's *proving* something

Beats:
- Doogan and Cheryl hit the flower shop (they already have the clue; Baxter has already given Doogan the location).
- They work the line out in front of the clerk—fast, competitive, funny.
- Jillian and her worthless boyfriend creep in and eavesdrop.
- Cheryl notices them and clocks what they're doing.
- Cheryl orders red roses and they just bring them roses so that's not it.
- Baxter is reading the sonnet in Doogan's ear and comes to "I have seen roses damasked, red and white,"
- Doogan orders a mix of red and white roses; the clerk smiles and hands them the next clue (envelope from under counter).
- The next clue is Pride and Prejudice-coded.
- Baxter finds a bookstore nearby.

Turn:
Cheryl decides they're not just trying to win—they're trying to *crush*.

Button:
They head for the bookstore—Jillian and her boyfriend still tailing.

---

## **9. Eddie's House — "Not on the Sign Out Front"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Eddie/Baxter/Abby — Planning Infiltration)

Purpose:
Bridge into the clinic-infiltration plan, show Baxter's limitations in the physical world, and let Abby be the pragmatic instigator.

How it plays:
- Eddie is home, still keyed up, on a FaceTime call with Baxter.
- Baxter is explaining (too earnestly, too technically) that he can't "hack a clinic" in a vacuum. That only happens in bad movies and tv shows.
- Baxter's point, translated: clinics don't post their IT inventory on a sign out front.
- Eddie pushes for magic; Baxter pushes back: he needs software names, vendor clues, *anything*.
- Abby walks in mid-complaint, hears "inventory" and "clinic," and immediately understands the real problem.
- Abby suggests the simplest solution in the world: Baxter should impersonate an IT tech and go look.
- Abby takes a jab at Baxter's whole vibe (stereotypical nerd, allergic to eye contact) and Baxter bristles—then admits she's right.
- Abby agrees to help him fake an IT uniform (shirt/badge/lanyard) just enough to get him past a tired front desk.

Turn:
Abby supplies the plan: stop trying to hack a mystery box; go get the software name.

Button:
Baxter, in an "IT uniform," is an idea everyone agrees to regret later.

## **10. The Speakeasy — "Hidden Bar and Getting to Know You"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Turning Point)

Purpose:
Deliver the hidden bar reveal, show Doogan's literary knowledge impressing Cheryl, and give them time to talk and get to know each other without dwelling on the complicated history.

**Opening Summary:**
Open with brief narration: After solving the Pride & Prejudice clue at the bookstore, they hit a travel agency (Jules Verne quote) and then got the To Kill A Mockingbird reference that led them here—to a taco place called Prohibition Tacos, which makes no sense.

**Cheryl Emotional Throughline:**
- Starts to be genuinely impressed by Doogan (turning point in her warming to him)
- Competitive fire still present but respect building
- Light conversation reveals personality without heavy emotional baggage

**Clue Mechanics (Specific):**
- Ask clerk for "mockingbird tacos" to access hidden door
- Bartender offers champagne (test)
- Doogan declines because Atticus Finch didn't drink in the book
- Bartender slides them water with golden ticket on coaster

Beats:
- Narration: Quick summary of bookstore → travel agency → TKAM clue → arrive at Prohibition Tacos.
- Prohibition Tacos looks like just a small taco place with a couple tables.
- Baxter says he found "it"—a Reddit post says to ask the clerk for mockingbird tacos.
- Doogan asks for mockingbird tacos; clerk gestures toward a hidden door in the back.
- They enter the Prohibition Speakeasy—a prohibition-era themed bar hidden behind the taco place.
- Jillian and her worthless boyfriend are already there with champagne flutes—how are they running that fast?
- But Jillian and boyfriend look lost, confused.
- While they wait for bartender, Cheryl and Doogan talk—light conversation, getting to know each other (avoid dwelling on complicated parts).
- Topics: where they're from, favorite books (since this is literature-themed), funny stories from past weddings, Cheryl's competitive nature in a lighter way.
- Keep it warm, natural, building rapport without heavy emotional revelations.
- Bartender approaches, offers Doogan and Cheryl champagne.
- Cheryl is about to accept (Jillian has champagne, must be right).
- Doogan notices the trick—declines. "We're not really drinkers."
- Bartender smiles, slides them a bottle of water.
- The coaster underneath is the golden ticket.
- As they leave, Cheryl asks: "So you don't drink?"
- Doogan: "Hell no. I drink a lot. Atticus Finch didn't drink in the book."
- Cheryl is impressed—this is where she starts warming to him.

Turn:
Doogan's literary knowledge wins the round and earns Cheryl's respect; conversation builds genuine connection.

Button:
They have the golden ticket; Jillian is still stuck inside with her champagne.

---

## **11. Clinic Infiltration — "Baxter Gets In (With Help)"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Eddie/Baxter/Abby — Infiltration Success)

Purpose:
Deliver successful clinic infiltration with Abby guiding Baxter remotely; introduce Nurse Nancy as foreshadowing.

**Sensory Notes:**
- Tension of undercover work
- Physical comedy of Baxter's nervousness
- Abby's calm guidance vs Eddie's anxiety

Beats:
- Eddie and Abby sit in car outside clinic.
- Eddie notices Baxter has another expensive earpiece: "How many of those things does he have? We need to check the IT expenses again."
- Abby (their accountant) dismisses the suggestion—there are bigger problems right now.
- Baxter enters clinic in Abby's improvised "IT uniform," armed with jargon and fear.
- Abby in his ear from the car, guiding him calmly.
- Temp receptionist waves him back—it's working.
- Baxter talks to temp, uses jargon, stays in character.
- Temp is bored, helpful, gives him what he needs: software names, system details.
- Baxter checking a printer in the back when Nurse Nancy appears.
- Nancy is sharp, impatient, clearly doesn't have time for this.
- She's a real bitch to him—snaps at him about the printer, questions who authorized this.
- Baxter stammers, stays in character just enough.
- Nancy leaves in a huff before digging deeper.
- Baxter gets out with the information they need.
- Back in car: Eddie relieved, Abby proud, Baxter shaken but successful.

Turn:
Baxter successfully gets software names; Nurse Nancy foreshadowed as future problem.

Button:
Baxter: "I got what we need. And I never want to do that again."

## **12. Finish Line — "Quid Agis?"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Hunt Victory)

Purpose:

**Cheryl Emotional Throughline:**
- Victory moment combined with dismissing Jillian (distraction working)
- Genuine interest in Doogan emerging—successful distraction has turned into actual attraction
- Invitation to rehearsal dinner = her making a move, not just accepting help

**CRITICAL MECHANICS:**
- Multiple teams have golden tickets (including Jillian - she copied Cheryl/Doogan at speakeasy)
- Golden ticket = access to final clue, NOT the prize itself
- Final clue "Quid agis?" determines actual winner
- Jillian has ticket but can't solve final clue (exposed as just copying)

**CRITICAL CHANGES (User Request):**
- Cheryl and Doogan see Jillian and boyfriend getting out of Uber (confirms cheating via ride share)
- Cheryl recognizes who Jillian is, dismisses it quickly—doesn't dwell, doesn't come up again
- Sylvia is NOT in this scene—Doogan asks Cheryl for more information about Sylvia
- Don't dig up past about Cheryl's sister at all—she's not thinking about that
- Doogan has done his job: Cheryl is successfully distracted and interested
- Scene ends with Cheryl implying she could use a ride to rehearsal dinner tonight
- Doogan is more than happy to oblige

Beats:

- Terry asks the finish-line question: "Are you done?"
- Other teams answer wrong, Jillian answers wrong
- The golden ticket has "Quid agis?" on the back—Latin
- Cheryl is about to answer, Doogan stops her: "It's a trick."
- Doogan needs to ask Cheryl about Sylvia's childhood (Harry Potter reference)
- Cheryl provides the context—warm conversation, enjoying talking to Doogan
- Baxter connects it: password/painting/phrase
- Terry asks again. Doogan answers: "Not until the fat lady sings."
- They win—Jillian exposed as just copying, Terry delivers burn
- Terry presents prizes (handbag for Cheryl, golf driver for Doogan)
- Cheryl clutching handbag, enjoying victory but MORE interested in Doogan
- Natural conversation continues—Cheryl clearly warming to him, distracted from wedding stress
- Scene ends with Cheryl implying she needs ride to rehearsal dinner
- Doogan happy to help

Turn:
They win, but more importantly: Cheryl is genuinely interested in Doogan (job working perfectly). Jillian exposed as fraud.

Button:
Cheryl implies she could use a ride to the rehearsal dinner tonight. Doogan's more than happy to oblige.

## **13. Eddie's House — "Debrief and Dead Ends"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Team — Progress Report + Doogan Update)

Purpose:
Bridge Doogan back into the investigation; show what the team has learned about Annabelle while exposing the Sebastian dead end; establish Baxter's ongoing work on medical software.

**Scene Flow:**
- Team (Eddie, Baxter, Abby) already in progress when scene opens
- Discussing what they've found about Annabelle
- Doogan arrives partway through the scene to get the update
- Baxter is in the room (not basement), working on medical software on his laptop
- It's complicated—Eddie responds "yeah...we covered that...not like the movies"

**Key Information Delivered:**
- They know more about Annabelle (clinic connection, her background)
- Sebastian doesn't make sense—no connection to clinic they can find
- Baxter can't find Sebastian anywhere in systems
- Eddie neglected to get company name for Sebastian's fake company
- Dead end on Sebastian—they have nothing to go on

**Baxter's Work:**
- Working on getting into medical software (complex, taking time)
- Not resistant—this is just hard technical work
- Progress is slow but he's making headway

How it plays:
- Scene opens with Eddie, Baxter, and Abby mid-discussion about what they've learned
- Baxter at laptop in living room, trying to crack medical software
- Eddie gives status: Annabelle's background, clinic connection confirmed
- Abby adds observations from infiltration
- Doogan arrives (between scavenger hunt and rehearsal dinner pickup)
- Team catches Doogan up: progress on Annabelle, but Sebastian is a ghost
- Eddie admits he screwed up: didn't get company name from Sebastian
- Without company name, they have no way to trace him
- Baxter: still working on medical software access—it's complicated
- Eddie: "Yeah...we covered that...not like the movies"
- Scene ends with Sebastian as dead end but medical software as ongoing work

This scene tells the audience:
**The team is making progress on Annabelle but Sebastian has vanished—and that's Eddie's fault.**

Notes:
- Doogan joins scene already in progress
- Baxter working throughout scene, not resisting
- Abby present and contributing
- Sebastian dead end is frustrating but clear

---

## **14. Rehearsal Dinner — "The Real Reason"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Emotional Reveal)

Purpose:
Reveal the true wedding landmine; show Cheryl and Doogan's developing connection; introduce surveillance threat.

**Setting Notes:**
- **Cheryl's house:** Nice but not ostentatious—two-story, perfectly landscaped, expensive neighborhood (similar style to Palmer residence but smaller scale, more urban professional than suburban family)
- **Doogan's Cougar:** 1970 Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible—faded dark blue paint, cracked leather, patched soft top, temperamental engine. Perfectly Southern California in convertible weather.

**Emotional Arc:**
- Cheryl happy to see Doogan but not too eager (wounded pride, self-protection)
- Falls in love with the Cougar—perfectly him, perfectly SoCal
- Drive is light, flirty, enjoying connection
- Dinner reveals deeper wound (Brad/Gabby history)
- Surveillance costs them the evening extension

Beats:
- Doogan arrives at Cheryl's door (nice house, perfectly landscaped, expensive part of town)
- She's happy to see him but maintains some reserve (not too easy)
- Walks her to his car—she sees the convertible 1970 Cougar
- Doogan assumes she'd be too fancy for it
- She falls in love with it: perfectly him, perfectly Southern California
- He opens passenger door for her (Father's Rule #1)
- Drive to rehearsal dinner: brief, light, flirty conversation (perfect convertible weather)
- **Narration bridge:** Cover drive time without dwelling—resume mid-sentence pulling into parking lot
- Jillian and boyfriend give them side-eye look heading in
- Wedding party table runs short of space
- Cheryl sneaks off to two-person table with Doogan
- Both keep eye out for toasts/duties
- Cheryl fills Doogan in on earlier rehearsal—ceremony will be obnoxious
- Doogan positive and supportive: "It's just one day"
- **Reveal:** Cheryl discloses Brad was her boyfriend first, she dumped him, Gabby swooped in
- Cheryl adds: "Gabby wouldn't see it that way, though" (self-aware, fair)
- Doogan keeps her buoyant, doesn't break Secrecy Rule
- Drives her home
- Cheryl: "I'd go just about anywhere with you, Doogan...as long as it's in this car."
- Doogan spots sedan that followed them from rehearsal dinner
- Guesses: people trying to frame him
- Declines to extend evening (big day tomorrow—wedding)
- Cheryl visibly disappointed but tries not to show it
- Doogan pulls away, sedan follows

Turn:
Cheryl reveals the Brad/Gabby history—Doogan realizes containment is the real job. Surveillance intrudes on personal connection.

Button:
Sedan follows Doogan away from Cheryl's house—surveillance is active and ongoing.

---

## **15. The One-Way Street Trap — "Are your friends investigating the clinic?"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Investigation Collision)

Purpose:
Establish the dynamic between Doogan and Martinez through clever cat-and-mouse interaction.

Beats:
- Doogan driving away from rehearsal dinner, calls Eddie and Baxter via phone/earpiece
- Eddie and Baxter ask how rehearsal dinner went
- Doogan says it was fine but he's being followed—car staying too far back to make out faces or license plates
- Baxter suggests heading downtown about half mile to one-way street near older part of town
- Eddie and Doogan confused—Baxter explains the trap:
  - Make sure they're following
  - Duck into one-way street and park
  - It's one-way—they can't turn around
  - They'll have no choice but to drive past you or park
- Doogan executes the plan
- As follower car approaches, Doogan recognizes it's Detective Martinez (not the people framing him)
- Martinez has questions anyway, so this is convenient
- Martinez approaches Doogan's parked car
- "Are your friends investigating the clinic?" Martinez asks about Eddie and has pictures of Baxter and Abby going into the clinic
- "Are you following us?" Doogan asks. "Yeah, that's how investigations work" Martinez replies
- Martinez suggests letting the real cops do the work
- But Martinez does admit to Doogan that things don't add up with Annabelle's murder but that doesn't mean Doogan isn't still the prime suspect

Button:
Martinez: "I am going to have more questions for you. Don't leave town."

---

## **16. Reception — "The Toast That Landed"**
**Timeline:** Doogan (Rebound Job — Success)

Purpose:
Deliver the rebound-job climax with lightness and fun—show that Doogan's presence transformed Cheryl, not through containment but through genuine distraction and connection.

**Tone:** Light, fun, romantic comedy energy. A LOT more fun than originally conceived.

How it plays:
- **Arrival:** Doogan arrives at the wedding venue. Terry and his assistant are in full wedding mode—running around with checklists, adjusting centerpieces, managing mini-crises with theatrical flair.
- Doogan sits on the bride's side. Cheryl spots him from across the venue, gives him a smile and a wink (she's happy he's there).
- **Ceremony (narrated):** Breeze through the ceremony with brief narration—it's long but not intolerable. Doogan sits politely through readings, vows, the works.
- **Reception seating:** Doogan is seated at a table nearby when Cheryl sneaks up behind him and sits down.
- **The 80-year-old's seat:** She's taken the seat of a lovely 80-year-old woman (former school teacher) who just left to find a soda.
- **Flirty exchange:**
  - Cheryl jokes: "Should I be jealous?"
  - Doogan: "We'll have to see what type of soda she finds."
  - They flirt, light and easy.
- **Reception activities:** Pass time through narration—Doogan is polite through what must be a very expensive dinner (chefs assigned to each table), full host bar, live band playing standards, the works.
- **Bridal party departs:** As the evening proceeds, the bridal party leaves the main table. Doogan gets another chance to see Cheryl.
- **Cheryl's transformation:** Doogan hasn't forgotten the parents' concern about the "toast from hell." But Cheryl isn't carrying that weight anymore. The distraction of Doogan is working—she's enjoying herself, lighter.
- **The Toast:** When it's time for the maid of honor toast, a different version of Cheryl stands up than the one Doogan met at the scavenger hunt the morning before. She's not carrying anything around like she was. She gives her sister and Brad a sweet, funny, heartfelt toast—genuine emotion, humor, no bitterness.
  - **Toast content:** Short and beautiful. Something about sisterhood, about how her sister always knew what she wanted (even when it wasn't convenient), about Brad being exactly the right kind of stubborn to keep up with Gabby, about wishing them a lifetime of making each other laugh.
  - **Inspiration notes:** Think classic maid of honor beats—childhood memory, roast-the-groom moment, genuine emotion—but keep it SHORT (3-4 paragraphs max).
- **Button:** After the toast, Cheryl returns to Doogan's table. She's glowing, relieved, transformed.
  - Doogan is visibly impressed.
  - Cheryl: "I think my work is done here. If you wouldn't mind taking me home."
  - Doogan (teasing): "What about the hokie pokie?"
  - Cheryl: "Screw the hokie pokie. You're coming with me." (She grabs his hand and pulls him out of the reception.)

This scene tells the audience:
**Sometimes the job isn't containment—it's giving someone a reason to let go of what's weighing them down.**

Notes:
- Light, fun, romantic energy—a LOT more fun than the original containment version.
- Terry's wedding planner chaos adds color and comedy in background.
- The 80-year-old school teacher moment is charming and adds levity.
- Cheryl's toast transformation is the PAYOFF—Doogan's work succeeded not through talking her down but by being there.
- Button is playful and romantic, not dramatic.

---

## **17. Final Scene — "The File That Vanished"**
**Timeline:** Investigation (Baxter/Eddie/Abby — Cliffhanger)
**Time:** Late evening (Doogan is at Cheryl's place for the night)

Purpose:
Close with the mystery hook: Annabelle flagged something real, and someone is actively erasing the evidence in real time.

**Setting:**
- Eddie's living room
- Eddie half asleep on the couch
- Abby on the couch next to him, online shopping on her phone
- Baxter in a chair using the coffee table as a computer desk

How it plays:
- **Opening:** Late evening, Eddie and Abby winding down
- Eddie is half asleep on the couch
- Abby is online shopping on her phone, sitting next to him
- Baxter is working at the coffee table, laptop open, clicking through files
- **"Hey, this is weird":** Baxter finds something
- Eddie stirs awake slowly
- Abby responds immediately
- **The flagged file:** Baxter reading aloud what he's found:
  - Pharmacy called about wrong name on prescription
  - Annabelle looked up the name—no billing or prescription records at all
  - Patient record exists but almost no other information
  - Serious painkiller prescription in wrong name—Annabelle flagged the file
- **The discovery:** As Baxter is reading, he goes to search for other files Annabelle might have flagged
- Some show up, but then they're gone
- Even the file he was just reading is gone
- **Real-time realization:** Someone is deleting files RIGHT NOW
- Someone is covering something up
- Button: Strong beat—villain is active THIS MOMENT

This scene tells the audience:
**Annabelle wasn't the story — what she found is. And someone is trying to erase it.**

Notes:
- Doogan is NOT present—he's at Cheryl's place for the night
- Late evening setting, team winding down
- Discovery happens casually, escalates to urgency
- Files disappearing in real time creates immediate tension
- End on cliffhanger: active threat, active cover-up
