## **1. Sunday Morning — "Brunch with the Plastics"**
**Day:** Sunday morning  
**Location:** Citrine & Sage Brunch Spot — trendy LA brunch spot

Purpose:
Reinvest the reader in Doogan, establish Nancy's character (obnoxious, unethical), set up the dog walk meeting, and paint the LA brunch culture scene.

How it plays:
- **Opens with garish sexual/embarrassing statement from the plastics' table** — establish tone immediately.
- Doogan already at the bar; Nancy and her friends (all bleached, botoxed, drinking champagne-heavy mimosas) at a nearby table.
- Team in earpiece feeding sparse background on Nancy and her brunch companions; Doogan trying to figure out an approach.
- **Nancy notices the table next to theirs has a full champagne bottle, hers is empty—she swaps them without anyone noticing.** Establishes her complete lack of ethics.
- Doogan clocks this and uses it as his angle: sends a fresh bottle of champagne to their table, on him.
- Waiter delivers; the women all check Doogan out, whisper (highly sexualized commentary), wave him over.
- Doogan joins; smart banter, all the women come on to him, but he keeps redirecting focus back to Nancy—wanting to know more about *her*.
- Gets almost nothing useful from the exchange except: Nancy mentions she's walking her dog at Traverse Park around 2pm today. They usually park near the BBQ pits.
- That's Doogan's opening for alone time.

Turn:
The bottle swap gives Doogan his approach angle—he weaponizes Nancy's lack of ethics to get close.

Button:
Nancy pushes a cocktail napkin with her number into Doogan's pocket, nudging his package. "I think I just got felt up."

Notes:
- Scene functions like the auction scene from Episode 3—immersive location, cultural detail, strategic social maneuvering.
- Nancy is sharp, obnoxious, bitchy—but not stupid.
- The plastics should feel like a pack; Nancy is alpha.
- Doogan's focus on Nancy (not the others) should feel deliberate, calculated.

---

## **2. The Drive Home**
**Day:** Sunday, post-brunch  
**Location:** Doogan's Cougar — driving home from Citrine & Sage

Purpose:
Brief scene to establish team's investigative dead ends and the pressure on Doogan to get information from Nancy. Status update on the mystery.

How it plays:
- Doogan driving home; team on comms (Abby, Eddie, Baxter).
- Debrief about brunch with Nancy and the plastics—playful jabbing, Abby bantering with Doogan.
- **Tone shift:** Team reports they've hit dead ends. Wondering about pharmacy connection, insurance company, other angles—but all speculation.
- They're depending on leads from Doogan's access to Nancy.
- Doogan realizes Nancy is their only real hope right now.
- Nancy doesn't seem like the type to have an attack of conscience and confess everything—or anything.

Turn:
Playful debrief shifts to the realization that the team is stuck; Nancy is the only path forward.

Button:
Doogan absorbs the weight: Nancy won't just confess. He's going to have to work for this.

Notes:
- Keep it brief—this is a status update scene, not a major plot beat.
- Establishes investigative pressure and raises stakes for Scene 6 (dog walk).
- Sets up urgency for the Nancy relationship.

---

## **3. Martinez Ambush**
**Day:** Sunday, shortly after Scene 2  
**Location:** Doogan's condo

Purpose:
Martinez inadvertently gives the team a critical new lead: Dr. Feldman is missing (or at least hard to reach). Raises the stakes and opens a new investigative direction.

How it plays:
- Martinez knocks on Doogan's door, pauses, announces himself—mentions they saw Doogan pull into the basement parking.
- Usual banter between Doogan and Martinez; Martinez comments on how nice the place is, once again wondering how a "consultant" makes this kind of money.
- **Martinez cuts to the chase:** Have Doogan or his "wannabe private investigator friends" seen Dr. Feldman?
- **Doogan is shocked**—they hadn't even thought to look for him. No, they haven't seen him.
- Martinez keeps his cards close to his vest, but does reveal: Feldman has been "a little difficult to reach."
- Doogan sees Martinez out.

Turn:
The Dr. Feldman question—Martinez accidentally hands them a new investigative angle.

Button:
Doogan immediately calls Eddie: "I'm heading over. I may have a lead on a new direction."

Notes:
- This is a CRITICAL scene—first mention of Dr. Feldman being missing/unreachable.
- Martinez doesn't intend to help; he'd rather they stay out of it.
- Doogan's shock should be genuine—Feldman wasn't on their radar.
- Sets up Scene 4 (strategy session) and Scene 5 (hunt for the doctor).

---

## **4. Strategy Session**
**Day:** Sunday afternoon  
**Location:** Eddie and Abby's house

Purpose:
Team regroups to process the Dr. Feldman lead and divide tasks. Establishes investigative direction for the episode.

How it plays:
- Eddie, Abby, and Doogan present; Baxter on FaceTime.
- Doogan briefs them: Martinez dropped in asking about the doctor—none of them had thought to look for Feldman.
- Baxter starts pulling up basic information on Dr. Feldman—not much available. Feldman's kept a pretty low profile since the clinic investigation a year or so ago.
- **Divide and conquer:** Doogan will take Nancy (meeting her at the park shortly for the dog walk). The rest will work on finding Dr. Feldman and figuring out why he might have disappeared.
- Quick tactical discussion: what to look for, where to start.

Turn:
From spinning their wheels to having two parallel leads: Nancy and Dr. Feldman.

Button:
Doogan checks the time—he needs to get to Traverse Park. "Let me know what you find."

Notes:
- Tone should be energized—finally they have direction.
- First mention of the clinic investigation timeline (a year ago).
- Sets up parallel investigations: Doogan/Nancy (Scene 6) and team/Feldman hunt (Scene 5).
- Brief scene—tactical, focused.

---

## **5. The Hunt for the Doctor - The Clinic**
**Day:** Sunday afternoon (concurrent with Doogan's prep for park)  
**Location:** The clinic

Purpose:
Establish that Dr. Feldman hasn't been to his own clinic in some time. Comic fumbling as clinic staff tries to cover. Confirms something is seriously wrong.

How it plays:
- Eddie leads the investigation this time (Baxter and Abby have already been there).
- Eddie poses as a pharmaceutical rep, wants to meet with the doctor.
- Gets the runaround from a temp receptionist and one nurse on duty—but it feels very practiced, rehearsed.
- Takes Eddie some time to figure it out, but: the doctor isn't at the clinic at all. Hasn't been for some time.
- **The temp eventually lets slip:** she hadn't even met him.
- Clinic staff isn't sure how to cover for their missing boss; they don't want a scene in front of patients.
- Tone: funny, bordering on fumbling. Staff is improvising badly.

Turn:
Eddie realizes the doctor's absence isn't temporary—it's a pattern.

Button:
Eddie on his cell phone, calling Abby and Baxter: "Something is definitely fishy about the doctor."

Notes:
- This scene should have comedic energy—Eddie playing pharm rep, staff fumbling the cover.
- The temp's slip is the key reveal: she's never met her boss.
- Establishes that Dr. Feldman's absence is prolonged, not just a day or two.
- Parallel to Doogan's park scene (Scene 6).

---

## **6. Walking the Dog with Nancy**
**Day:** Sunday afternoon, 2pm  
**Location:** Traverse Park (near BBQ pits)

Purpose:
Nancy inadvertently reveals the prescription fraud scheme. Establishes her complete moral bankruptcy through dog-poop-in-stroller incident. Builds the relationship for later scenes.

How it plays:
- Doogan meets Nancy as planned (she gave him the hint at brunch—not accidental).
- Nancy in designer tracksuit, designer tennis shoes, walking Athena (shih tzu) with designer collar and leash.
- Nancy is flirty but still superficial and morally bankrupt.
- **Dog poop incident:** Athena poops on grass. Nancy pretends not to see it. Man on bench coughs, points to sign about picking up after pets. Nancy grudgingly pulls bag from box, picks it up.
- **Can't find trash can—drops the bag INTO a baby stroller of a couple walking opposite direction, deep in conversation, not noticing.**
- Doogan runs back to fetch it, apologizing profusely, carries it to next trash can.
- During walk: Doogan comments she's clearly very successful. Nancy alludes to being a "hustler"—you have to be in this town to keep up. Mentions "other business interests" that help. Might be time to consider new opportunities.
- **Doogan sneezes.** Nancy offers to get him meds to help.
- **KEY REVEAL:** Doogan asks if she can prescribe. Nancy: "Sort of." The doctor doesn't care if she writes prescriptions. **"We all do it."** They have a pharmacy that doesn't care if the signatures match.
- Nancy says they should do it again, slips Doogan her number (written on paper), gropes him a bit.

Turn:
The prescription fraud reveal—Nancy casually admits to forging prescriptions.

Button:
Baxter and Abby call to debrief. Doogan: "It was...an experience."

Notes:
- **CRITICAL SCENE:** First direct confirmation of prescription fraud at the clinic.
- The stroller incident establishes Nancy's character completely—she's awful.
- Nancy's casualness about the fraud ("We all do it") shows how normalized it is at the clinic.
- Sets up the need to investigate the pharmacy (Scene 11).
- Doogan's horror at the stroller incident vs. maintaining cover = key tension.

---

## **7. The Hunt for the Doctor - Home**
**Day:** Sunday afternoon/early evening (Day 1)  
**Location:** Dr. Feldman's home — mid-sized house in older part of Pacific Point

Purpose:
Establish that Dr. Feldman is fleeing and that there's criminal surveillance on his house. First visual confirmation of organized crime connection.

How it plays:
- Baxter finds the doctor's address online; Eddie heads over.
- House is mid-sized, in older part of Pacific Point—probably purchased when the doctor was making "extra" money on painkillers.
- Eddie waits outside, notices a car down the road with a guy watching him.
- Eddie drives away, pulls around the corner to the street on the other side of the house.
- Sneaks through neighbor's yard, over a fence into the doctor's backyard.
- **Through windows: sees house is all packed up. Someone is getting ready to move out.**
- On his way back to the car, Eddie reports to Baxter about the other car.
- Eddie drives back by the surveillance car, quickly uses cell phone to capture video of the man.
- Baxter grabs a still image, runs it through facial recognition.
- Nothing...nothing...oh, wait. **A mugshot.**

Turn:
House is packed up (doctor fleeing) + surveillance car + mugshot = organized crime involvement.

Button:
Baxter staring at the mugshot on his screen. This just got a lot more dangerous.

Notes:
- Establishes Dr. Feldman is actively fleeing, not just absent.
- First concrete evidence of criminal organization watching the situation.
- Eddie doing fieldwork (vs. his usual sales/coordination role) adds tension.
- The mugshot reveal sets up the escalation and danger level.
- Sets up Scene 8 (break-in planning).

---

## **8. The Clinic Break-In Planning**
**Day:** Sunday evening (Day 1)  
**Location:** Eddie and Abby's home

Purpose:
Team plans the clinic break-in. Doogan reluctantly agrees to distract Nancy with dinner. Sets up parallel action for Scene 9/10.

How it plays:
- All four main characters present in person (Doogan, Eddie, Abby, Baxter).
- **Doogan updates on Nancy situation:** she casually admitted to prescription fraud, the pharmacy doesn't care if signatures match. Also: hopes he never has to see her again.
- **Eddie updates on the doctor's house:** something is up. If the doctor is moving, the clinic will probably shut down soon—they have to act fast to get any evidence.
- **Baxter's proposal:** he's been reviewing info from his IT visits to the clinic. Thinks he can defeat their electronic door locks with a device.
- Eddie reluctantly agrees to break into the clinic—but they need to be sure Nancy won't show up.
- **Doogan has to take one for the team again:** ask Nancy to dinner.
- Picks a time late enough that the clinic is closed.
- Doogan calls Nancy right there—she's up for dinner the next night (Monday).

Turn:
From gathering intel to active plan: break in while Doogan keeps Nancy occupied.

Button:
Doogan hangs up with Nancy. "The plan is in place." (And he's dreading it.)

Notes:
- This is a planning/strategy scene, not the actual break-in.
- Establishes timeline: dinner is Monday night (Day 2).
- Doogan's reluctance to see Nancy again adds comedic/character layer.
- Sets up Scene 9 (dinner with Nancy) and Scene 10 (clinic encounter) as parallel action.
- Break-in happens while Nancy is at dinner with Doogan.

---

## **9. Dinner with Nancy**
**Day:** Monday evening (Day 2)  
**Location:** Trendy LA restaurant (the type of place people want to be seen)

Purpose:
Keep Nancy distracted during break-in—until an alarm goes off. Forces Doogan to drive Nancy to the clinic, creating immediate crisis for the team.

How it plays:
- Doogan meets Nancy at the restaurant bar.
- Nancy has already had a couple of drinks before dinner.
- She's very money-oriented: orders expensive appetizer, expensive bottle of wine. Doogan politely plays it off.
- While talking, **alarm goes off on Nancy's phone. "The clinic."**
- Nancy fumbles with her phone for a while before saying she has to go.
- **Doogan realizes:** Eddie and Baxter set off an alarm they didn't know about.
- Doogan offers to drive her—she's had a couple of drinks.
- Nancy reluctantly agrees. (Internal motivation: can't risk a DUI with everything else going on—doesn't say this aloud.)

Turn:
The dinner distraction backfires—Nancy gets an alarm notification and now Doogan has to take her to the clinic.

Button:
They leave. Doogan sneaks a quick text to the gang: **Warning them he's incoming with Nancy.**

Notes:
- **CRITICAL TURN:** The plan falls apart. Doogan now has to protect the team's cover while maintaining his own.
- Nancy's reluctant agreement to let him drive shows she's smart enough to avoid complications.
- Transitions directly into Scene 10 (clinic encounter).
- Doogan's earpiece would be too risky to use with Nancy right next to him in the car.

---

## **10. The Clinic Encounter**
**Day:** Monday evening (Day 2)  
**Location:** The clinic

Purpose:
High-stakes comedic tension as Doogan has to get Eddie and Baxter out while maintaining cover. Sacrifice play that traps Doogan in an unwanted situation.

How it plays:
- Doogan and Nancy arrive at the clinic; **Eddie and Baxter still stuck inside.**
- Abby calls Doogan quietly—she's been unable to reach them until just when Nancy and Doogan pulled into the parking lot.
- Nancy goes in; doesn't want Doogan to follow but he plays protective gentleman. She can't resist, lets him tag along.
- Nancy checks all doors—locked as they should be.
- Beelines to Exam Room 1, flips on light—empty.
- Doogan follows her inside; Nancy excuses herself to check the file room.
- **Eddie and Baxter hiding in lower cabinets on near wall.** Eddie cracks cabinet door to tell Doogan.
- Nancy starts to search around the room.
- **Doogan distracts her by kissing her.** She's thrown off but likes it.
- Doogan: this is kind of "kinky." That catches her attention.
- Suggests it might be hotter if she was...you know, in uniform.
- Nancy: there's a stash of nurses uniforms in the staff lounge.
- Doogan acts excited; Nancy excuses herself to change.
- **Doogan gets Eddie and Baxter out.**
- Eddie gives brief speech about falling on a grenade for fellow soldiers, brothers in arms in a foxhole.
- Doogan rolls his eyes; they leave.
- **Just in time:** Doogan back in exam room as Nancy returns in nurse uniform, closes door.
- Nancy gives him a look that says he's in big trouble...sexually.

Turn:
Doogan's distraction works—team escapes. But now he's trapped in the exact situation he didn't want.

Button:
Nancy in the nurse uniform, door closed, that look. Doogan realizes what he's gotten himself into.

Notes:
- High-tension comedy—very close call with Eddie and Baxter.
- Doogan's sacrifice play shows team loyalty but costs him personally.
- Eddie's "grenade" speech adds levity to the tension.
- Sets up the uncomfortable reality: Doogan may have to follow through to maintain cover.
- Scene should feel like a heist-gone-wrong that's resolved through quick thinking and sacrifice.

---

## **11. The Pharmacy Recon**
**Day:** Tuesday (Day 3)  
**Location:** The pharmacy / Eddie's car

Purpose:
Subvert expectations about the pharmacy being a criminal operation. It's a sweet family business, not organized crime—adds nuance to the investigation.

How it plays:
- **Opens with Eddie doing pharmacy recon in his car.**
- Doogan on comms; Eddie trying to get details about the night before.
- Doogan avoids questions other than: it was a brave sacrifice.
- Eddie reuses his pharmaceutical rep cover (from the clinic visit).
- Goes in to ask questions about the pharmacy and their relationship with the clinic.
- **What Eddie assumed:** crooked pharmacy allowing shady clinics to write painkiller prescriptions.
- **What he finds:** sweet old couple (definitely not fully coherent) and their 18-year-old granddaughter who's really running the show.
- This is not a crime organization. This is a sweet family business.

Turn:
The pharmacy isn't criminal—they're unwitting participants or just negligent.

Button:
Eddie: "If there is any crime happening here, it's an accident."

Notes:
- Adds moral complexity—pharmacy isn't evil, just overwhelmed/naive.
- The granddaughter probably doesn't understand full implications.
- Shifts the investigation back toward the clinic and Dr. Feldman.
- Doogan's avoidance of clinic-encounter details adds comedy.
- This scene should feel lighter, almost poignant—contrast to expectations.

---

## **12. Strategy Session**
**Day:** Tuesday (Day 3)  
**Location:** Eddie and Abby's home — kitchen

Purpose:
Full team debrief. Introduce Frank Charles info. Establish next moves: Eddie returns to doctor's house, Doogan cooks dinner for Nancy (budget constraints add comedy).

How it plays:
- Eddie arrives back from pharmacy; finds Doogan, Abby, and Baxter in the kitchen.
- Still jabs about Nurse Nancy and the clinic encounter—Doogan deflects.
- **Status review:**
  - The doctor is in the wind.
  - Nancy seems in the middle of something but won't say what.
  - Pharmacy is probably part of it but not knowingly.
- **Baxter has more info on the surveillance guy from Scene 7:**
  - Name: Frank Charles.
  - Did time in Arizona on petty theft charge.
  - They dropped a bigger racketeering charge—couldn't make it stick.
  - Not much more on him, but: lives in an apartment building in Studio City. Baxter found his cell phone number.
- **Next moves:**
  - Eddie will head back to the doctor's house (their only lead) and look around.
  - Doogan agrees to do a follow-up dinner date with Nancy.
- **Abby points out:** He should cook this time. They don't expense these costs like they do clients. The lawyers' bills don't leave budget for Nancy's dinner and wine tastes.
- Doogan reluctantly agrees.

Turn:
From scattered investigation to focused plan: Eddie on doctor, Doogan on Nancy.

Button:
Doogan walks out of the room, already on his phone calling Nancy.

Notes:
- Frank Charles introduction—first named criminal connection.
- Budget constraint adds realism and comedy (Nancy's expensive tastes).
- Sets up Scene 13 (Martinez ambushes Eddie) and Scene 15 (dinner with Nancy).
- Doogan cooking for Nancy = more intimate setting, higher stakes.

---

## **13. Martinez Ambushes Eddie**
**Day:** Tuesday (Day 3)  
**Location:** Street near Dr. Feldman's house

Purpose:
Martinez catches Eddie but inadvertently gets a lead on Frank Charles thanks to Baxter's quick thinking. Raises stakes while showing team's cleverness.

How it plays:
- Eddie sitting in his car a few cars back from **Frank Charles, who's still watching the doctor's house.**
- Eddie talking to Baxter on comms—isn't sure what to do.
- **Baxter has an idea:** A couple minutes later, Frank Charles pulls out and aggressively drives away.
- Eddie asks what Baxter did: **Baxter spoofed the property manager's phone number from Frank's apartment building, called him about a fire.**
- Eddie pulls up further down the street to head to the doctor's house.
- Before he can get far, hears a voice: **"Mr. Palmer. Another stakeout." It's Martinez.**
- They have a conversation; Eddie gets quick message to Baxter: **"Call Frank. Tell him mistake—different building."**
- Baxter isn't sure why but does it.
- Martinez and Eddie banter; Martinez accuses Eddie of knowing more than he lets on.
- Eddie: Abby would disagree with that assertion.
- **Just then: Frank comes back down the street.**
- **Martinez and Frank lock eyes. Frank pulls a 180 and speeds away.**
- Martinez runs to his car to chase, calling out vehicle description and plate number over radio.

Turn:
Baxter's clever phone trick accidentally delivers Frank Charles to Martinez.

Button:
Eddie standing there alone. "Well done, Baxter."

Notes:
- Shows Baxter's technical cleverness and quick thinking.
- Martinez accidentally benefits from the team's investigation.
- Frank fleeing when he sees Martinez confirms he's involved in something criminal.
- Eddie's quick thinking (calling Frank back) creates the opportunity.
- Scene has comedy (Eddie's mild panic, Baxter's confusion) and tension.
- Sets up potential pursuit subplot for Martinez.

---

## **14. Conversation with Dr. Feldman**
**Day:** Tuesday (Day 3)  
**Location:** Dr. Feldman's house

Purpose:
Major revelation scene. Doctor reveals he's been coerced by a criminal organization that now controls his clinic. Explains the larger scheme but not the specifics. Confirms Annabelle's connection.

How it plays:
- Eddie following Baxter's instructions for picking the lock—it's not working.
- Out of frustration, **Eddie just kicks the door open.**
- Starts poking around inside.
- **A man with a golf club springs out from one of the rooms, tries to attack Eddie.**
- Eddie disarms him without either man getting hurt.
- The doctor sits down, defeated.
- **Eddie asks questions. The doctor's story:**
  - While his practice was under investigation (painkillers), he was contacted by a group that wanted to "help."
  - In exchange for getting the investigation dropped, they'd take over a small part of his practice.
  - He agreed because he had no choice.
  - Since then: he's just a signature and the name on the clinic.
  - **Something is going wrong:** Patient files disappear. Patients he's never even seen or met end up dead.
  - He doesn't know what's going on.
  - The people who got him into this won't let him out—feels like it's about to meltdown completely.
- Eddie asks about the receptionist (Annabelle).
- Doctor: **She was hired after this group took over clinic operations. He'd barely met her.** She sounded like a sweet girl though—very sad.

Turn:
The doctor is a victim, not a mastermind. A criminal organization controls the clinic and is responsible for the murders.

Button:
Eddie leaving the doctor's house: "It's not quite a dead end as much as it's feeling like the edge of a waterfall."

Notes:
- **CRITICAL SCENE:** Establishes the criminal organization as the true antagonist.
- Doctor is sympathetic—coerced, trapped, scared.
- Confirms Annabelle was hired by the organization, not the doctor.
- Patient files disappearing + deaths = identity theft scheme (hints at larger pattern).
- Eddie kicking the door = comedic beat in tense scene.
- Golf club attack shows doctor's desperation/fear.
- "Edge of a waterfall" = they're getting close to something dangerous.

---

## **15. Dinner Confessions**
**Day:** Tuesday evening (Day 3)  
**Location:** Doogan's condo

Purpose:
Episode cliffhanger. Nancy is the victim—she unknowingly brought the drugged wine. Same setup as Episode 1, but Nancy dies. Shows the organization silencing loose ends.

How it plays:
- **Scene opens with knock at Doogan's door.**
- Nancy with a bottle of wine in each hand: red is her personal favorite, white was a gift but looks good.
- Doogan sets white on table, glances at red. They're having braised short ribs—red will be perfect.
- Dinner almost ready; Doogan opens the red, examines label. Good winery from Paso Robles. Nancy has taste, even if she doesn't have ethics.
- They chat; Doogan asks about the doctor.
- **Nancy:** Really doesn't know him. **She was hired by a different company and assigned to the clinic.** Doctor comes in only every now and then. Not very bright. Just a signature most of the time.
- They keep drinking. Nancy worried she wouldn't hear from him after their last "night like that." Sometimes men don't call after.
- Doogan: "I'm not like that."
- **Nancy starts getting physical; Doogan gracefully avoiding advances.**
- They eat dinner, finish the red.
- Doogan going to pull another red from his wine fridge in the next room.
- **Nancy just opens the white, pours them both deep pours.**
- Doogan returns with the red, but Nancy hands him his glass with the white. How can he refuse?
- He drinks a bit. **She tips his hand with hers to get him to drink deeper.**
- Nancy admits: just wants to "loosen him up a bit more." Refills his glass.
- **Doogan starts to feel something. Nancy pushes the glass up to his mouth.**
- **Then he sees it: "Woodmark Vineyards."**
- Scene gets hazy—just like the last scene of Episode 1.
- **Doogan blacks out.**

**JUMP CUT:**

- Doogan feels a tap on his forehead. **It's Martinez again.**
- **Martinez:** "We really should stop meeting this way, Mr. Andrews."
- **Doogan is once again in bed with a dead woman.** This time it's Nancy.

Turn:
Nancy wasn't framing Doogan—she was a victim too. The organization used her to eliminate another loose end while framing Doogan again.

Button:
The exact same nightmare from Episode 1. History repeating. Doogan framed for another murder—but this time the victim is Nancy.

Notes:
- **CRITICAL CLIFFHANGER:** Episode ends on the same beat as Episode 1.
- Woodmark Vineyards = the callback that makes Doogan realize he's been set up.
- **Nancy didn't know where the white wine came from**—it was a "gift" (planted by the organization).
- Nancy's actions (tipping his hand, refilling glass, pushing) were flirtation, not malice.
- Nancy is another loose end eliminated by the organization—she knew too much.
- The organization kills two birds: silence Nancy, frame Doogan again.
- Sets up Episode 5: Doogan must clear himself again while the organization closes in.
- Martinez's line is perfect callback: "We really should stop meeting this way, Mr. Andrews."

**END OF EPISODE 4**
