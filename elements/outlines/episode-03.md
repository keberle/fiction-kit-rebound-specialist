How it plays:
- Abby enters clinic using fake appointment with earpiece (Baxter providing surveillance support)

- Receptionist directs her to Exam Room 4 to wait
- While waiting, Abby slips out into hallway with Baxter guiding

- Inside: break room with filing cabinet (5 drawers, barrel locks, all locked)
- Baxter tries to guide her through lock-picking via Reddit thread
- Abby: "Do you actually know how to pick locks?"
- Baxter admits he's reading about it in real-time

- Abby insists on leaving, Nancy trails her like guard
- Abby cancels appointment at reception, walks out
- **In the car, Bluetooth call to Eddie/Baxter:**
- Reports: got patient list but Nancy caught her
- Baxter confirms: same nurse who kicked him out
- Abby describes Nancy: "Nice nails though. French tips. Professional. Not cheap."
- Eddie: "Hostile head nurse living beyond her means."
- Abby: "Whatever she's hiding, she threatened a patient to protect it."
- Abby: "Extremely territorial. We're not getting back in there."
- Eddie: "Then we'll have to find another way."

Turn:
Nancy is introduced as an obstacle but not yet identified as the key player. The nail detail is mentioned but not flagged as important.

Button:
Baxter: "I'll keep working on the digital files I pulled. There has to be something in there."
Abby: "And I'll start visiting patients. If we can't get the files, we'll go directly to the source."

Establish the B-plot investigation. Show what Baxter salvaged before files disappeared.

How it plays:

- Baxter: "I have patient names and addresses. But no diagnoses, no treatment plans, no billing codes. Someone deleted those from the database."
- Abby: "So we have a list of people but no idea why they were patients?"
- Baxter: "Exactly. I've got about forty names. Some flagged by the insurance company, some not."
- Eddie studies the list. "We need to visit them. Find out what they were being treated for."

## **6. Tuesday Afternoon — "Patient Visits (Healthy Pattern)"**
**Day:** Tuesday afternoon  
**Location:** Investment firm office, residential home in modest neighborhood, three-way phone call

**AS WRITTEN (MAJOR CHANGES FROM OUTLINE):**

**Part 1: Eddie visits Trevor Hastings (finance broker, NOT elderly patient)**
- Opens with Eddie mid-appointment posing as potential investment client
- Trevor Hastings: Alpha dog investment broker stereotype
  - Corner office, yacht/marathon photos, expensive watch
  - "Aggressive growth with managed downside exposure"
  - Marathons, Crossfit at 5 AM, manages $200M portfolio
  - "Bloodwork of a 25-year-old"
  - COMPLETELY HEALTHY despite 13 prescriptions in clinic records
- Eddie confused by how healthy this guy is

**Part 2: Abby visits Richard Pemberton's home (DECEASED patient)**
- Son is DEAD (died 3 months ago)
- Mother answers door, invites Abby in
- Sweet, sad scene: mother shows pictures
- Son had cancer, poor insurance
- IRELAND TRIP detail: Son took mother to Ireland to see grandparents' homeland before he died
- Photo: son gaunt but happy near Irish coast
- Mother comforted by trip memory
- Visit is sweet but short

**Part 3: Three-way phone call (Abby + Eddie + Baxter)**
- Compare findings as Abby leaves house
- Pattern emerges:
  - Crossed-out names = DEAD patients (not marked deceased in clinic system)
  - High-prescription patients = HEALTHY people (shouldn't need medication)
- Questions raised:
  - Why no death certificates in clinic records?
  - Where are the pills going if healthy people have prescriptions?
  - What is Nancy doing?
- Insurance/Medicare fraud suspected
- More questions than answers

**NO elderly patients comedy. NO bunion story. NO Mrs. Chen or Mrs. Yamamoto.**

Turn:
Pattern crystallizes: backwards fraud (healthy over-prescribed, dying under-recorded). Mystery deepens.

Button:
"Her son shouldn't be dead. If someone at that clinic had actually treated him instead of crossing his name off a list..." (Emotional weight, not comedy)

## **7. Wednesday Morning — "The Driving Range / Winston Arrives"**
**Day:** Wednesday morning (before Pro-Am Round 1)  
**Location:** Hidden Hills Golf Course - driving range

Purpose:
Introduce Winston Reilly as Brenda's caddy substitute. Show Doogan's strategic thinking about Brenda's needs. Demonstrate Mara's skepticism turning to understanding. Marcus relieved of caddy duties.

How it plays:
- **Setup:** Brenda and Mara already at range with Marcus wearing caddy vest with Brenda's name on it (research PGA caddy vest details for accuracy)
- Marcus is clearly struggling with the weight of the golf clubs
- Doogan arrives pulling a hand cart (PGA-legal equipment), accompanied by elderly Black man (late 60s) wearing country club casual attire with golf spikes
- **Introductions:** Doogan introduces him to Brenda as "Winston Reilly, an old friend"
- Winston shoots Doogan a look (they just met, not old friends) but doesn't contradict him publicly
- **The Pitch:** Doogan suggests Marcus being the caddy would prevent him from capturing all the moments for social media effectively
- Winston could step in as caddy instead - better for content creation
- Marcus immediately grateful (clubs are too heavy)
- Brenda uncertain about Winston carrying clubs until Doogan points out the hand cart (allowed by rules)
- **Mara's Skepticism:** When Doogan returns to Mara, she's skeptical about this arrangement
- Doogan explains Winston's background:
  - Frequents a nearby 9-hole municipal course
  - Old guys like Winston have been playing golf for decades
  - They know they don't have 300-yard drives on par 5s anymore
  - They stay conservative and efficient
  - They don't have power, they need tactics
  - They're almost always short game assassins
  - "This is exactly what Brenda needs"
- Mara less skeptical now - sees the strategic thinking
- **Subtext:** Establishes Doogan thinks several moves ahead
- Shows Doogan's understanding of golf strategy beyond just his own game
- Winston as tactical asset, not just equipment carrier

Turn:
Mara realizes Doogan isn't just competent—he's strategic and thinks about what people actually need.

Button:
Winston settles in with Brenda, demonstrating immediate calm influence. Short, efficient ending.

## **13. Thursday Night — "The Nancy Connection"**
**Day:** Thursday night  
**Location:** Video call between Eddie/Abby/Baxter

Purpose:
Team puts both patterns together. Identify Nancy as common link. Recall nail salon detail and make plan.

How it plays:
- Video call. All three on screen. Baxter has been digging through remaining files.
- Eddie: "So we have healthy patients being billed for fake treatments, and dying patients with hidden records."
- Abby: "The question is: who connects them?"
- Baxter: "I've been looking at the partial nurse assignments in the files that didn't get scrubbed."
- He pulls up data: "The healthy patients—Mrs. Chen, Mrs. Yamamoto, Mr. Peterson—they all saw different nurses. Patricia, Linda, Grace, Marcus."
- Abby: "Different nurses. No pattern."
- Baxter: "Right. But the patients with minimal records—the ones who are sick or dead? I cross-referenced with shift schedules."
- He highlights a name: "They all saw the same nurse. Nancy Weller."
- Eddie leans forward: "All of them?"
- Baxter: "Every single one. Mr. Rodriguez, Ms. Tran, Michael Foster—Nancy was their assigned nurse."
- Abby: "The wife mentioned a nurse with fancy nails."
- Eddie: "So Nancy's seeing the sick patients, and their records are being hidden."
- Baxter: "And she's been at the clinic for fifteen years. Long enough to know how the system works."
- Abby: "What do we know about her?"
- Baxter pulls up basic info: "Nancy Weller. 47 years old. Head nurse. Lives in Culver City."
- Eddie: "Head nurse. So she has access to everything."
- Abby: "We need to know more about her. Who she is, how she lives, what she's hiding."
- Eddie: "But we can't just walk into the clinic. Martinez has seen me there. And Abby, Nancy already spotted you."
- Long pause. Everyone thinking.
- Eddie suddenly remembers: "Wait. When we were staking out the clinic a couple weeks ago, there was a nail salon down the street. I went in once to use their bathroom, and the nail tech looked at me like I was casing the place."
- Abby sits up: "Nail salon?"
- Eddie: "Two blocks from the clinic. Kim's Nails."
- Abby, recalling: "Wait. When I ran into Nancy at the clinic Sunday, she had really nice nails. I mentioned it—elaborate nail art, expensive looking."
- Baxter: "That's Nancy Weller. The same nurse."
- Eddie: "A nurse making $85K a year doesn't get work like that done at a strip mall unless she's a regular."
- Baxter: "And if she's a regular, the nail tech probably knows things."
- Abby grins: "Perfect. I'm going undercover."
- Baxter: "What's the angle?"
- Abby: "I'm getting my nails done tomorrow after the tournament. And I'm going to ask about Nancy."

Turn:
Nancy identified as key person of interest AND they have a plan to get intel on her.

Button:
Eddie: "Be careful. If she's involved in this, she's dangerous."
Abby: "Don't worry. I speak fluent nail salon."
Baxter: "I'll keep digging into her background. See what I can find before you go in."

How it plays:
- Single-round stroke play. All 40 pros compete.
- Doogan caddies for Mara
- Morning 9 holes: Mara playing loose, confident golf
- She's chatting with gallery, making jokes, clearly enjoying herself
- Candy also playing well - but she's all business, serious
- They're paired together for back 9 as leaders
- Mara's good nature is noticeable - she compliments Candy's shots, jokes with fans
- Candy is thrown off by it. She's used to Mara being cold and serious.
- "What's with you this week?" Candy asks, suspicious.
- Mara, genuine smile: "I'm just having fun. You should try it sometime."
- Candy gets visibly frustrated. Mara's relaxed confidence is getting under her skin.
- Through 17 holes: They're tied
- Jake on phone with Eddie between holes: "I've got four endorsement deals interested. Four. Including a major athletic brand."
- Eddie: "The plan is working."
- Jake: "No. It's better than the plan. She's actually happy."
- 18th hole: Par 5, 520 yards, dogleg right with tall trees on right side
- Baxter in Doogan's earpiece: "High-pressure weather system over the course. Air density is higher than normal."
- Doogan to Eddie on comms: "What does that mean?"
- Baxter: "Ball won't carry as far as players expect. Especially anyone used to Arizona's elevation and dry air."
- Doogan pieces it together. Candy is from Scottsdale. She's going to overestimate her drive.
- At the tee, Mara looks at the flag, calculating. Candy's already decided—she's going for it.
- Mara asks Doogan: "What do you think? I can reach it in two."
- Doogan, quietly: "Lay up. Trust me."
- Mara studies his face. She's learned to trust him this week. Nods.
- Mara plays conservative, lays up safe
- Candy goes aggressive, powerhouse drive
- Candy's ball doesn't carry like she expected - clips the trees, ends up in deep rough
- Mara's safe play leaves her clean approach shot
- Mara makes par easily. Candy struggles to bogey.
- **Mara wins by one stroke**

Turn:
Victory. And Mara knows Doogan's advice made the difference.

## **15. Friday Evening — "Kim's Nails"**
**Day:** Friday evening  
**Location:** Kim's Nails salon

Purpose:
Abby goes undercover at nail salon. Gets dirt on Nancy. Baxter runs background. Episode climax.

How it plays:
- Abby enters Kim's Nails. Small salon, Kim is the owner/main tech.
- Abby sits in Kim's chair, friendly and chatty
- Gets the conversation flowing - compliments Kim's work on other customers
- Abby casually: "I saw a woman with the most amazing nails earlier today. Your work? Really intricate design, lots of detail."
- Kim lights up: "Oh! Probably Nancy. She's one of my regulars. Always wants the most elaborate designs."
- Abby: "She seemed interesting."
- Kim lowers her voice, glances around: "Between us? She's kind of a nightmare."
- Abby raises an eyebrow, encouraging
- Kim continues: "Always pays cash - never tips well though. Complains about everything. But she wants the best work, so..." Kim shrugs.
- Abby: "She works at that clinic on Maple, right? I think I saw her there."
- Kim nods: "Head nurse. Been there forever. Acts like she owns the place."
- Abby, fishing: "She must do well. Those nails aren't cheap."
- Kim laughs: "Girl, her nails are just the start. She's had work done." Gestures to her own face. "Lots of work. Botox, fillers, probably a lift or two."
- Abby: "Good for her."
- Kim: "Expensive though. I don't know how she affords it on a nurse's salary."
- Meanwhile: Baxter is listening in via Abby's phone, running background checks
- Baxter types away, finding financial records, cross-referencing
- Kim finishes Abby's nails. Abby tips generously (showing contrast to Nancy).
- Outside, Abby calls Eddie and Baxter from her car

Turn:
They have intel on Nancy - expensive lifestyle, lots of plastic surgery, pays cash, living beyond her means.

Button (In the car call):
Abby: "So Nancy's living way beyond what a head nurse should make. Expensive plastic surgery, designer lifestyle, but stays off the radar by paying cash."
Baxter on speaker: "I pulled her financials. Her official income is $85K a year. But she owns a condo worth $600K, drives a Mercedes, and has no debt. The math doesn't work."
Eddie: "She's getting money from somewhere else."
Abby: "The clinic. Whatever they're running, she's making bank from it."
Eddie: "So how do we prove it? We can't just walk in there."
Abby pauses, then grins: "No. But I know someone who can get close to her."
Eddie: "Who?"
Abby: "Think about it. Nancy's single, bitter, expensive tastes, loves attention. She's two procedures away from full muppet mode but thinks she's hot. We need someone charming who can make her feel special."
Eddie catches on: "Oh no."
Abby: "Oh yes. Doogan."
Eddie: "He just finished a week-long job. He's going to hate this."
Abby: "He's going to love it. He just doesn't know it yet."
