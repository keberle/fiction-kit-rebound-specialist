# Episode Outline

**Title:** The Professional Golfer
**Episode:** 3
**Theme:** Doogan is realizing he's in over his head so a weekend distraction is a good thing.  Doogan uses this to remind himself that his job is important to the targets of his rebound jobs.  He's a good guy and he is doing a good thing.  The rebound is a female professional golfer who left the sport to have a child and is now trying to return as a single mom balancing the physical and emotional toll of trying to reclaim greatness on the LPGA circuit.

**Notes:** Mara and Candy both make it all the way to the tournament final and Doogan has Eddie talking in the earpiece along with Baxter.  Baxter points out that there's a high pressure system in the area.  As they come up to the 18th hole Doogan asks how much of a high pressure system.  Eddie figures out where he's going with that.  That US Open at Pebble Beach in 2010, Dustin Johnson's shots didn't carry the tall trees and clipped branches.  Candy is used to playing in Arizona so she's over estimating this drive.  Have Mara lay up.  Candy is about to end up in the wilderness.  Mara isn't sure but she's learned to trust Doogan.  Mara ends up winning the hole and the pro competition on the last day.

**Story Arc:** While Doogan is busy distracting Mara, the team is working to figure out what type of patient file they got a glimpse of at the end of season 2.  Something just isn't right about that clinic.  Baxter is able to pull some patient files before they're deleted and they have some names and addresses.  Abby divides up the names and addresses and the team goes looking.  This can serve as small, quick scenes with Eddie and Abby going to visit patients to try and find out what's happening at the clinic.  Somehow Eddie gets the dead end patients and ends up helping old people around the house.  Meanwhile, Abby stumbles upon a patient with meds on the counter but the name on the prescription label isn't the patient's name and the patient is evasive about that.  Then she sees the same pattern at anohter house.  Now they have their next clue.  When Abby agrees to give one of the secretly terminal patients a ride to the clinic, she notices that the nurse that comes out to greet her, she has very distinct nails.  Abby knows the nail tech who does those.  She heads to the nail salon and conveniently gets that tech, and starts asking questions about Nancy indirectly.  The nail tech finally lets it slip that she always pays in cash and that she's a raging bitch.  Abby knows just the guy to charm her.  The episode ends with the nail salaon scene and with Abby gloating "Doogan is going to love this one".

**Hook / Cold Open:** Doogan watches Mara shank balls at the driving range while distracted by a video call with her son—she's emotionally split before the tournament even starts.
**End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Abby grins at the nail salon mirror: "Doogan is going to love this one."

## **1. Cold Open — "Driving Range at Dawn"**
Purpose:
Introduce Mara's emotional state—show how being separated from her son fractures her focus.

How it plays:
- Early morning driving range. Mara sets up a ball, then her phone buzzes. Video call.
- She answers. Her son ALEX (4) appears on screen, excited: "Mommy, Daddy's making pancakes!"
- She smiles, but it's strained. "That's great, baby. Be good for Daddy, okay?"
- Her ex's voice offscreen: "Say bye, buddy. Mommy has to practice."
- Alex waves. Call ends. Mara stares at the blank screen.
- She swings. Shanks it badly. Another. Worse.
- A man's voice: "You're collapsing your trailing elbow."
- Doogan is leaning against the fence, watching. He says it gently, like he's commenting on weather.
- Mara bristles. "Thanks. I'm aware."
- Doogan: "You're also gripping like you're trying to strangle something. Rough morning?"
- Mara exhales. "My son's with his dad this weekend. First tournament since I came back, and I can't even—" She stops herself. Why is she telling a stranger this?
- Doogan steps closer, not crowding. "Hit one more. But this time, pretend you're showing him how it's done. Like he's watching."
- Mara hesitates. Sets up. Swings. Pure contact. The ball sails.
- She stares at it, then back at Doogan.

Turn:
Mara realizes she hasn't hit a clean shot in weeks—and a stranger just unlocked something.

Button:
"I'm Doogan. And for what it's worth, pancakes are a good sign. Means he's trying."

## **2. Eddie's House — "The Patient List"**
Purpose:
Establish the investigation thread; show Baxter's partial success; divide the labor.

How it plays:
- Living room. Baxter is on a laptop, Eddie and Abby crowding around.
- Baxter pulled six patient files from the clinic system before whoever was deleting caught him.
- The files are incomplete—names, addresses, some medical notes, all flagged by Annabelle.
- Baxter can't figure out what they have in common. Different ages, different conditions.
- Eddie wants to visit them all today. Abby points out that's insane.
- Abby divides the list: three for her, three for Eddie.
- Eddie: "Why do you get to pick?"
- Abby: "Because you'll somehow give yourself the country club zip codes."
- Baxter mutters that statistically, Eddie's addresses are in lower-income areas.
- Eddie protests. Abby smiles. "You're welcome."

Turn:
The team has a lead—now they just have to figure out what they're looking for.

Button:
Abby to Baxter: "Keep digging. And tell us immediately if anyone else logs into that system."

---

## **3. Country Club — "The Rebound Brief"**
Purpose:
Establish the job parameters and show Doogan's reluctance—he's not sure this one is ethical.

How it plays:
- Doogan meets the client: Mara's agent, Candace Reyes—slick, fast-talking, clearly stressed.
- Candace explains: Mara was a top-10 LPGA player before she left to have a baby. The father disappeared. Mara's been trying to come back for eight months but she can't focus.
- The job: distract her, get her out of her head, give her three good tournament days.
- Doogan hesitates. "She's got a kid."
- Candace: "The kid is why she needs this. She's so worried about failing her daughter that she can't swing a club."
- Eddie (on phone, listening): "The money is very good, Doogan."
- Doogan watches Mara through the window—she's in the clubhouse, bouncing Lily, looking lost.

Turn:
Doogan agrees. But he's already protective.

Button:
"One rule: the daughter is off-limits. I'm not using a toddler to run a con."

- Eddie introduces himself as a "community health liaison" doing wellness checks.
- Mr. Henderson is delighted. Invites him in. Offers lemonade.
- Eddie tries to steer the conversation toward the clinic. Mr. Henderson doesn't remember much—nice place, nice nurses.

- "While you're here, young man, could you help me with something?"
- Cut to: Eddie on a ladder, cleaning gutters, while Mr. Henderson supervises from below.
- Eddie on earpiece to Baxter: "I'm cleaning gutters. This is not what I signed up for."
- Baxter: "Did you at least get the prescription names?"

Button:
Eddie climbs down. Mr. Henderson waves. "Same time next week?"

---

## **5. Pro-Am Day One — "The Pairing"**
Purpose:
Build Doogan/Mara chemistry; show Doogan's golf knowledge through Baxter.

How it plays:
- Pro-Am tournament. Doogan is "coincidentally" in Mara's amateur foursome.
- Baxter is in Doogan's earpiece, feeding him golf intel.
- Mara is tense, overthinking every shot. Her amateur partners are corporate guys who don't help.
- Doogan stays loose, makes jokes, takes pressure off her.
- On the fourth hole, Mara shanks into the rough. Frustration boiling.
- Doogan walks over casually. "You're thinking about the baby."
- Mara: "What?"
- Doogan: "Your grip tightens when you're anxious. And you checked your phone on the last tee box."
- Mara is caught off guard. "She's with a sitter. I just—"
- Doogan: "She's fine. Hit the ball."
- Mara takes a breath. Swings. Clean contact.
- Baxter in the earpiece: "How did you know about the grip thing?"
- Doogan (sotto): "I didn't. Lucky guess."

Turn:

Button:
End of the round. Mara's score improved eight strokes. She looks at Doogan differently.

- Abby uses a cover story: she's from a patient advocacy group, checking on clinic experiences.
- Donna is friendly but guarded. Lets her in.
- Abby spots pill bottles on the kitchen counter. Multiple bottles.
- She casually picks one up. "Heavy medication schedule."
- Donna takes it back quickly. "Just some vitamins."
- Abby clocks the name on the label: "Patricia Weller." Not Donna.
- Abby doesn't push. Keeps talking. Notes the address for later.
- Outside, Abby texts Eddie: "First patient. Prescription bottles with someone else's name. She got weird when I noticed."

Turn:
Abby has found a pattern—she just doesn't know what it means yet.

Button:
Abby checks her list. Two more visits.

---

## **7. Eddie's Patient Visit #2 — "Mrs. Kowalski's Television"**

How it plays:
- Eddie at another modest home. MRS. KOWALSKI (70s, Polish accent) opens the door.
- Eddie tries the same wellness check approach.

- Mrs. Kowalski: "You look like a handy young man."
- Cut to: Eddie behind the TV, untangling cables, while Mrs. Kowalski directs him.
- Baxter in earpiece: "Eddie, you're supposed to be investigating."
- Eddie: "She made me pierogies. I'm not leaving until I fix this."
- He fixes the TV. Mrs. Kowalski hugs him. Still no useful intel.

Button:
Eddie leaves with a Tupperware of pierogies and zero leads.

## **8. Tournament Day Two — "The Quiet Dinner"**
Purpose:
Deepen Doogan/Mara connection; show her vulnerability about the co-parenting situation.

How it plays:
- Evening. Clubhouse restaurant, mostly empty. Mara is eating alone, scrolling through photos of Alex on her phone.
- Doogan appears. "Mind if I join you, or is this a solo brooding session?"
- Mara laughs despite herself. "Brooding is a strong word. I prefer 'strategic reflection.'"
- They talk. She's playing well but feels guilty—this is the longest she's been away from Alex.
- Doogan asks about Alex's dad. Mara gives the short version: a fling that went on too long, but when she got pregnant, she kept it.
- "He's actually a decent dad. When he can be. He's got his own life, his own career. We were never going to be a family. But he shows up for Alex."
- Doogan: "That's more than a lot of guys do."
- Mara: "I know. That's what makes it complicated. I can't hate him. I just... wish it had been different."
- A beat. Vulnerability hangs in the air.
- Her phone buzzes. Video from Alex's dad: Alex in pajamas, waving goodnight.
- Mara watches it twice. Doogan doesn't rush her.
- Mara: "He sent this so I wouldn't miss bedtime."
- Doogan: "Sounds like he's trying."
- Mara looks at Doogan—really looks. "You're weirdly good at this. Talking, I mean."
- Doogan: "I've had practice."

Turn:
Mara is starting to trust Doogan—and that's dangerous.

Button:
Mara: "Same time tomorrow? I could use the company." Doogan nods. She doesn't know she just asked a con man on a date.

## **9. Abby's Patient Visit #2 — "Same Pattern"**
Purpose:
Confirm the prescription anomaly is systemic—raise the stakes.

How it plays:
- Abby at a second apartment. Different patient, same setup.
- This time it's an older man (GERALD), clearly terminal. Hospice vibes.
- He's more open—talks about the clinic being "so helpful" with his "special situation."
- Abby spots the pill bottles again. Same deal: name on the label doesn't match the patient.
- She asks casually: "Is Patricia a family member?"
- Gerald gets nervous. "Just a friend. She picks up my prescriptions. Easier that way."
- Abby knows he's lying but doesn't push.
- Outside, she calls Eddie: "Second patient, same pattern. Someone named Patricia is on all these prescriptions, but she's not the patient."

Turn:
Abby realizes the clinic is running something through patient medications.

Button:
Abby: "I've got one more patient. If it's three for three, we have a real problem."

---

## **10. Eddie's Patient Visit #3 — "The Leaky Faucet"**
Purpose:
Complete Eddie's comedy arc; cap his useless patient run with maximum domestic absurdity.

How it plays:
- Eddie's final house. He's visibly defeated.
- This patient (MR. YAMAMOTO, 70s) is sharp, remembers the clinic, but has nothing useful.
- Eddie is about to leave triumphant—no manual labor!
- Mr. Yamamoto: "Actually, while you're here..."
- Cut to: Eddie under a sink, wrench in hand, fixing a leaky faucet.
- Baxter: "Eddie, you've fixed gutters, a TV, and now plumbing. You're basically a handyman service."
- Eddie: "I'm building community relationships, Baxter. This is networking."
- Mr. Yamamoto brings him tea and thanks him profusely.
- Eddie has spent the entire day doing chores and has learned nothing.

Button:
Eddie calls Abby: "Please tell me you found something, because I've got nothing but carpal tunnel."

## **11. Abby's Patient Visit #3 — "The Ride to the Clinic"**
Purpose:

How it plays:
- Abby's third patient: MARGARET, 60s, frail but dignified.
- Margaret is terminally ill—she knows it, Abby can tell.
- Margaret mentions she has a clinic appointment and her usual ride fell through.
- Abby offers to drive her. Margaret gratefully accepts.
- At the clinic, Abby waits in the car. Margaret goes in.
- A nurse comes out to help Margaret inside. Abby watches.
- The nurse turns slightly—Abby catches her hands. Distinctive nail art: elaborate, expensive, unmistakable.
- Abby knows those nails. She knows that nail tech.
- Margaret returns. Abby drives her home, distracted, thinking.
- In her car after drop-off, Abby makes a call: "Hey, I need to make an appointment. Today if possible. With Kim."

Turn:
Abby has a lead that doesn't require Baxter's hacking—old-fashioned legwork.

Button:
Abby smiles. This is her world.

- Baxter starts explaining atmospheric effects on ball flight.
- Eddie: "In English, Baxter."

- Doogan can't communicate with Mara directly—but he can communicate with her caddie.
- He intercepts the caddie during the walk. Whispers: "Tell her to lay up. Trust me."
- The caddie hesitates. Mara trusts this guy?
- Caddie delivers the message. Mara looks at Doogan in the gallery. He gives a slight nod.
- Mara lays up while Candy goes for the aggressive line.
- Candy's ball clips the tall trees—doesn't clear. She's in trouble.

- Candy struggles to bogey. Mara wins by one stroke.

Turn:
Mara wins—and knows Doogan helped, even if she doesn't know how.

Button:

- Abby walks in, triumphant.
- She lays it out: Nurse Nancy. Head nurse at the clinic. Cash-only lifestyle. Difficult personality.
- Eddie: "So she's involved in whatever the clinic is hiding."
- Abby: "She's not just involved. She's probably running it."
- Baxter: "How do we get close to her?"
- Abby grins. "She's single. She's bitter. And she's exactly the type who'd go for a charming guy who makes her feel special."

Turn:

Button:
Abby, grinning at her phone: "Doogan is going to *love* this one."
