**Story Arc:** 
**A-Plot (Mara):** Week-long celebrity Pro-Am. Mara paired with comedian Brenda Atwood (and her bumbling dramatic assistant Marcus). Doogan as substitute caddy (auction winner cover story). Sunday: Doogan meets Jake/Eddie, gets briefing. Monday evening gala introduces team. Tuesday skills day, Doogan impresses Mara. Wednesday-Thursday Pro-Am rounds, team chemistry builds. Friday exhibition finale: Mara vs Candy, 18th hole weather gambit, Mara wins by one stroke. Shows personality in victory interview, sponsors call Jake.

**B-Plot (Investigation):** Before files disappeared, Baxter exported incomplete patient data (names, no diagnoses). Eddie and Abby divide list, visit patients undercover. Eddie keeps getting elderly patients who want to hang out (conveyed through dialog in group calls). Abby discovers pattern: patients with minimal medical history are dead/dying; patients with extensive medical history are healthy (some are douchebags). Comparing notes: Eddie's patients saw different nurses, unusual patients all saw Nurse Nancy. After tournament ends Friday, Abby goes to clinic, spots Nancy's distinctive nails. Remembers Eddie complaining about nail salon near clinic. Abby goes undercover to salon, gets dirt on Nancy (plastic surgery, expensive lifestyle, cash-only, doesn't tip, real bitch). Baxter runs background while listening - Nancy living beyond her means. Abby realizes Doogan is perfect to investigate Nancy. Episode ends with this setup.

**Martinez Subplot:** Thursday after Pro-Am Round 2, Martinez confronts Doogan in parking lot. Returns earpiece from Episode 2, questions the high-end surveillance equipment. Points out he's investigated Doogan more than he's let on (expensive building, Eddie's business). Reminds Doogan not to leave town. Episode ends with Baxter already tracking Martinez.

**Nancy Introduction:** Sunday evening/Monday morning after Jake meeting, Abby attempts to access hard copy files at clinic. Nancy catches her wandering. Abby leaves with prescriptions but no files. Reports encounter to team—same nurse who kicked Baxter out. Detail about nice nails goes unnoticed until Eddie recalls nail salon Friday evening.

**Hook / Cold Open:** Sunday afternoon - Doogan meets Eddie and Jake at Hidden Hills Golf Club to discuss Mara job. Establishes stakes before tournament begins.

**End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Friday evening after nail salon - Abby to Eddie: "I know exactly who can get close to Nancy. And he's going to hate this."

## **1. Sunday Afternoon — "The Rebound Brief"**
**Day:** Sunday afternoon  
**Location:** Willow Creek Country Club, Pacific Point — 14th hole tee box

Purpose:
Establish the job parameters through Eddie's pitch to Jake while they're playing golf. Show Doogan's interest—this sounds like a nice change of pace.

How it plays:
- Eddie, Doogan, and Jake Townsend are playing golf at Willow Creek Country Club in Pacific Point (Jake's local club, not the tournament venue)
- 14th hole tee box. Eddie's turn. He addresses his ball, mid-thought.
- Eddie: "—and that's exactly what I'm saying, Jake. We're the ones to handle this situation. The basics will be figured out over time. We can get straight to the inner details."
- Jake watching Eddie's setup, curious but cautious
- Doogan off to the side, picking up on something in Eddie's tone
- Eddie swings. Clean contact. Ball sails toward the fairway.
- Jake: "You make it sound simple. But Mara's... complicated."
- Eddie, collecting his tee: "Complicated is our specialty. Right, Doogan?"
- Doogan, watching Jake's body language: "This is about more than just her disposition, isn't it?"
- Beat. Jake hesitates.
- Eddie: "Come on, Jake. We've been walking this course for forty-five minutes. Just tell us."
- Jake exhales: "Fine. Yes. It's about endorsements. She can't get deals."
- Doogan exchanges a look with Eddie
- Jake continues: "Three-time major champion. Playing the best golf of her life right now. Incredible comeback story—single mom, Hawaiian heritage, C-section recovery. But sponsors won't touch her."
- Eddie: "Because?"
- Jake: "Because she's too dry in interviews. Too focused. Too technical. She doesn't smile. She doesn't show personality. They want warm, relatable, inspirational. She gives them robot."
- Doogan leans against his driver, interested now
- Jake: "I've got less-talented players landing six-figure endorsements because they're fun in press conferences. Mara can barely get a meeting."
- Eddie grins: "That's our specialty."
- Doogan has to agree: "That is what we do best."
- Jake looks between them, hopeful: "You really think you can help her?"
- Eddie: "We've done harder. Right, Doogan?"
- Doogan: "A week at a golf resort helping someone find their confidence? Honestly, Jake, this sounds like a nice change of pace."
- Jake, cautiously optimistic: "It's the Hidden Hills Celebrity Pro-Am. Charity tournament, no tour pressure. Her regular caddy's visiting family. You'd fill in as substitute."
- Doogan: "How do we explain me suddenly being her caddy?"
- Jake: "Monday night gala has a charity auction. One of the lots is caddying for Mara all week. You win it."
- Eddie: "Perfect cover story."
- Doogan, warming to it: "When does it start?"
- Jake: "Gala's Monday evening. Tournament runs Tuesday through Friday."
- Eddie, to Doogan: "This is the fastest you've ever said yes to a job."
- Doogan: "After the last few weeks? I need normal. This sounds normal."
- Jake: "Normal and beautiful. Mara's... well, you'll see. But one thing—she's got walls up. Thick ones. Don't take it personally."
- Doogan smiles: "Walls are kind of my specialty."

Turn:
Jake reveals the real problem isn't Mara's golf—it's her marketability. Doogan's genuinely interested—this is exactly the kind of job they excel at.

Button:
Eddie, grinning as they walk toward their balls: "A legit LPGA pro, buddy. Charity golf tournament, oceanside resort. This might be the first job I'm actually jealous about."
Jake: "Don't let Abby hear you say that."

## **2. Sunday Evening — "The Clinic Visit"**
**Day:** Sunday evening (after Jake meeting)  
**Location:** The clinic, then Abby's car

Purpose:
Establish Nancy early. Show Abby trying to get hard copy files. Introduce Nancy as a character they've encountered but don't yet realize is significant.

How it plays:
- Abby enters clinic using fake appointment, hoping to access hard copy files while waiting
- Checks in at reception with false name and complaint
- Receptionist directs her to exam room to wait for doctor
- While waiting, Abby slips out into hallway, looking for records room
- She's checking door labels, trying to be casual
- Nancy emerges from around corner, suspicious
- Nancy, cold and authoritative: "Can I help you? You should be in your exam room."
- Abby, apologetic: "Sorry, I was looking for the bathroom."
- Nancy, not buying it but can't prove anything: "Down the hall, on your right. Please return to your exam room after."
- She watches Abby walk to bathroom, then return to exam room
- Later: Doctor examines Abby (minor complaint), writes prescriptions
- Abby leaves with prescription for painkiller and anti-depressant but no files
- **In the car, Bluetooth call to Eddie/Baxter:**
- Abby: "No luck. Couldn't get near the file room."
- Eddie: "What happened?"
- Abby: "Got caught by some bitchy nurse. She spotted me in the hallway."
- Baxter: "Wait, describe her."
- Abby: "Blonde, probably late forties but clinging to her youth by every medical means possible. Very stereotypical Southern California. Raging bitch."
- Baxter: "That's her! That's the same nurse who ran me out when I was pretending to be IT."
- Abby: "Her name tag said Nancy."
- Baxter, remembering: "Yes! Nancy. I remember now."
- Abby, in mocking Karen tone: "'Nurse Nancy.' She was a piece of work. Nice nails, though."
- Eddie: "So we've got a hostile head nurse who's territorial about that clinic."
- Abby: "Extremely territorial. We're not getting back in there."
- Eddie: "Then we'll have to find another way."

Turn:
Nancy is introduced as an obstacle but not yet identified as the key player. The nail detail is mentioned but not flagged as important.

Button:
Baxter: "I'll keep working on the digital files I pulled. There has to be something in there."
Abby: "And I'll start visiting patients. If we can't get the files, we'll go directly to the source."

## **3. Monday Evening — "Welcome Gala & Auction"**
**Day:** Monday evening  
**Location:** Hidden Hills Clubhouse

Purpose:
Establish tournament setting, introduce Brenda and her assistant, show Candy/Tilly chaos, Jake watching nervously. Establish Doogan's "auction winner" cover story through actual auction win.

How it plays:
- Black-tie gala, speeches about women's empowerment and STEM scholarships
- Live charity auction in progress - various lots for the cause
- Mara arrives alone, professional but isolated, greeting sponsors with forced smiles
- Doogan positioned in back, watching the auction lots roll by
- Various items go by: golf lessons with pros, spa packages, luxury dinners
- Doogan is politely bored, sipping champagne
- Auctioneer announces next lot: "Caddy for the week with three-time major champion Mara Kingsley! Perfect chance to get insider tips from a pro!"
- Doogan perks up. This is it.
- Bidding starts at $500. A couple of wealthy golf enthusiasts raise paddles.
- $1,000. $1,500.
- Doogan raises his paddle. $2,000.
- Another bidder. $2,500.
- Doogan again. $3,000.
- The room notices the competition. Jake, watching from across the room, looks nervous.
- Final bidder drops out. "Sold for $3,000 to bidder number 47!"
- Applause. Doogan nods, trying to look pleased like an enthusiastic golf fan.
- After the auction winds down, Jake intercepts him with JAKE TOWNSEND's manager (or tournament coordinator)
- Manager leads them to where Mara stands near the bar
- Manager: "Mara, this is Doogan Andrews. He's your caddy for the week—just won the lot!"
- Mara: "The auction winner. Right." (Matter-of-fact, for charity)
- Mara sizes him up: "Have you ever caddied before?"
- Doogan, with a slight grin: "I've seen 'Tin Cup.' Does that count?"
- Mara actually cracks a smile—first genuine one all evening. "That's a no, then."
- Doogan: "I know my way around a course. I'll carry your clubs, read the greens, and stay out of your way."
- Mara: "We'll be at the driving range tomorrow. Eight AM. Don't be late."
- Pairing announcement made by emcee: Mara is matched with BRENDA ATWOOD (comedic actress) and Brenda's assistant MARCUS (bumbling, dramatic)
- Brenda, nearby, overhears and perks up: "Wait, is that eight AM for us too? That's early for actresses."
- Mara gives her a look. "Yes. Eight AM."
- Brenda is warm, self-deprecating: "I should warn you, I'm terrible. But Marcus is worse, so at least I look good by comparison."
- Marcus, over-dramatically: "I once hit the same water hazzard from two holes. Not joking."
- Mara almost smiles again. Almost.
- Across the room: CANDY makes entrance with TILLY. Photographers swarm. Everything is content.
- Mara watches them with thinly veiled disdain
- Press moment: Reporter approaches Mara. "Your comeback has taken longer than many expected. How do you respond to critics who say you've lost a step?"
- Mara, defensive: "Well, Phil Mickelson never had to recover from a C-section, did he?"
- The room goes quiet. Jake visibly cringes across the room.
- Reporter backs away awkwardly. Sponsors notice. Not the vibe.
- Doogan appears with champagne: "That was... bold."
- Mara: "I'm tired of apologizing for having a child."
- Doogan: "You shouldn't have to. But maybe there's a way to say it that doesn't sound like you're at war with the world."
- Mara looks at him sharply, but he's moved on to introduce himself to Brenda

Turn:
The teams are set. The week begins. Mara is wound tight, defensive, and about to spend a week with a caddy who might change that.

Button:
Eddie (phone): "How did it go?"
Doogan: "Made it through the auction, met her. She's nice."
Eddie: "How much did the caddy job end up costing?"
Doogan: "3 grand."
Eddie: "I'll let Abby know. Add it to the expense report. What's next."
Doogan: "Driving range tomorrow."
Eddie: "Don't do the authentic swing speech, ok?"
Doogan: "Anyone ever tell you that you watch too many movies?"
Eddie: "It's come up."

## **4. Monday Evening — "The Patient List"**
**Day:** Monday evening (concurrent with gala)  
**Location:** Eddie's home office

Purpose:
Establish the B-plot investigation. Show what Baxter salvaged before files disappeared.

How it plays:
- Eddie at his desk. Baxter's video on monitor. Abby enters with coffee.
- Baxter explains: "I got into the clinic's system before someone scrubbed the patient files. Exported what I could, but it's incomplete."
- Eddie: "How incomplete?"
- Baxter: "I have patient names and addresses. But no diagnoses, no treatment plans, no billing codes. Someone deleted those from the database."
- Abby: "So we have a list of people but no idea why they were patients?"
- Baxter: "Exactly. I've got about forty names. Some flagged by the insurance company, some not."
- Eddie studies the list. "We need to visit them. Find out what they were being treated for."
- Abby: "Undercover?"
- Eddie: "Community health liaison. Wellness checks. We've done it before."
- They divide the list. Eddie gets roughly half, Abby gets the other half.
- Baxter mutters something about Eddie's addresses being in lower-income neighborhoods.
- Eddie: "Great. I love old people. They tell great stories."

Turn:
The investigation begins with incomplete information—they'll have to do legwork.

Button:
Abby: "If someone deleted these files, they're hiding something. Let's find out what."

## **5. Tuesday — "Golf for Fun Day"**
**Day:** Tuesday (Fun Day)  
**Location:** Hidden Hills Golf Course - fun day

Purpose:
Build Doogan/Mara chemistry. Show Brenda/Marcus comedy. Show Candy/Tilly being insufferable. Incorporate Mara's emotional moment with Alex.

How it plays:
- Morning: Golf for Fun Day skills competitions - longest drive, closest to pin, putting contests
- Before it begins: Mara at driving range, her phone buzzes. Video call.
- Her son ALEX (3) appears on screen, excited. Her mother's voice: "Alex, say hi to Mommy!"
- Alex waves. "Hi Mama! Tutu made pancakes!" (Tutu = Hawaiian for grandmother)
- Mara smiles, strained. "That's wonderful, baby. Are you being good for Tutu and Papa?"
- Her mother: "He's perfect. You focus on your tournament. We've got him."
- Call ends. Mara stares at blank screen, missing home.
- She swings. Shanks it badly. Another. Worse.
- Doogan appears: "You're collapsing your trailing elbow."
- Mara bristles. "Thanks. I'm aware."
- Doogan: "You're also gripping like you're trying to strangle something. Rough morning?"
- Mara exhales: "My son's back in Hawaii. First big tournament since I came back, and I can't even—" She stops.
- Doogan: "Hit one more. But this time, pretend you're showing him how it's done. Like he's watching."
- Mara hesitates. Sets up. Swings. Pure contact. The ball sails.
- She stares at it, then back at Doogan. He just nods and walks toward the skills competition area.
- During skills competitions: Doogan demonstrates solid golf knowledge - impresses Mara with wind reads
- Marcus makes every shot dramatic theater: "Oh my GOD, Brenda, did you SEE that?!"
- Brenda is genuinely terrible but trying so hard
- First half of day: Mara is still tense, frustrated when Brenda shanks shots
- **TURNING POINT - Halfway through:**
- Brenda apologizes again for a bad shot. Mara starts to snap at her.
- Doogan interrupts smoothly: "You know what Brenda reminds me of? Every pro golfer's first tournament. We all sucked once."
- Mara pauses. Looks at Brenda's earnest face.
- Doogan, flirting subtly: "Plus, watching you try to teach her is actually impressive. Not everyone can break down mechanics like that. It's kind of... attractive."
- Mara blinks. Is he flirting with her? On a golf course?
- Something shifts. She laughs. Actually laughs.
- From that point on: Mara is lighter, warmer with Brenda
- Shows her how to fix her grip instead of sighing when she messes up
- Candy and Tilly nearby, filming everything for content
- Doogan to Mara quietly: "Do they ever just... play golf?"
- Mara laughs again: "No. And it used to drive me crazy. Now I kind of feel sorry for them."
- By end of day, Mara has smiled more than she has in months

Turn:
Mara realizes Doogan knows golf, respects her game, and doesn't need her to be anything but herself. She starts having fun. First real crack in her armor.

Button:
Walking off course. Brenda: "Thank you for being patient with me today."
Mara, genuinely: "You're actually getting better. And you make this fun."
Doogan catches Jake's eye from distance. Jake nods—it's working.

## **6. Tuesday Afternoon — "Abby's First Visit"**
**Day:** Tuesday afternoon (while Doogan is at Golf for Fun Day)  
**Location:** Patient home in Glendale, then Abby's car

Purpose:
Show first half of investigation pattern. Healthy patient with extensive medical history doesn't make sense.

How it plays:
- Abby arrives at modest home in Glendale. Knocks.
- Mrs. Chen, 68, answers. Looks healthy, energetic.
- Abby introduces herself as community health liaison doing wellness checks on clinic patients
- Mrs. Chen invites her in. House is clean, active lifestyle evident (yoga mat, walking shoes)
- Abby checks her notes: Mrs. Chen should have diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic heart condition
- Abby asks about her health. Mrs. Chen: "Never felt better! I walk three miles every day."
- Abby: "And your medications? How are those going?"
- Mrs. Chen shows her pill organizer: Five different prescriptions from the clinic
- Abby: "Do you take all of these?"
- Mrs. Chen: "Every day, like they said. Though honestly, I don't know what half of them do."
- Abby asks who her primary nurse was. Mrs. Chen: "Oh, I saw different nurses. Patricia, I think? And Linda once."
- Abby thanks her, leaves
- **In the car, calling Eddie/Baxter (video call on dashboard):**
- Abby: "Mrs. Chen is healthier than I am. Takes three-mile walks daily. But she's on five prescriptions for conditions I don't think she has."
- Eddie appears on screen, looks exhausted: "How'd your visit go, Eddie?"
- Eddie: "Mrs. Yamamoto. Lovely woman. Ninety-two years old. Made me tea. Then asked if I could help with her feet."
- Abby: "Her feet?"
- Eddie: "Bunions, Abby. I'm not good at sanding bunions. I am not qualified for bunions."
- Baxter laughs off-screen
- Eddie: "But she's healthy. Really healthy. And she's got a whole pharmacy in her cabinet."
- Abby: "Who was her nurse?"
- Eddie checks notes: "Someone named Grace."
- Abby: "Mrs. Chen saw Patricia and Linda. All different nurses."
- Baxter: "What about the patients with minimal records? The ones I flagged as unusual?"
- Abby: "That's tomorrow's list."

Turn:
Healthy patients with extensive prescription records. Something's wrong but they don't know what yet.

Button:
Eddie: "I'm going home. My hands smell like foot cream."
Baxter: "You're a professional, Eddie."
Eddie: "Nobody's that professional."

## **7. Wednesday Afternoon — "Pro-Am Day 1"**
**Day:** Wednesday afternoon  
**Location:** Hidden Hills Golf Course - full 18 holes, tournament conditions

Purpose:
Show Mara under tournament pressure with amateur partner. Doogan as caddy.

How it plays:
- **Format:** Best Ball - both play own ball, team takes better score per hole
- Tournament pressure. Galleries watching. Media coverage.
- Doogan caddies for Mara - carries bag, reads greens, gives club selections
- Mara is tense. This counts for real now.
- Brenda struggles but has occasional good shots that count for team
- Marcus provides constant comic relief from sidelines (he's her partner but not playing seriously)
- But Best Ball format means Mara can mostly carry the team
- They're middle of the pack but surviving
- Candy/Tilly team doing well (Candy's drives dominating, Tilly just having fun)
- Key moment: Mara faces difficult approach shot. Doogan suggests laying up. She trusts him. It works.
- After the round: Press approaches. Same reporter from Monday.
- Reporter: "Better round today. How are you feeling about your game?"
- Mara, smiling instead of defensive: "I'm feeling great. My partner Brenda's been amazing, and my caddy actually knows what he's doing."
Jake on phone with Eddie: "That was better. Much better. She smiled. She joked. She sounded like a human being."
Eddie: "Progress."
Jake: "Don't jinx it."

---

## **8. Wednesday Evening — "Abby's Second Visit"**
**Day:** Wednesday evening  
**Location:** Three patient homes in East LA, then Abby's car

Purpose:
Show other half of the pattern. Patients with minimal records are sick or dead. Pattern is backwards.

How it plays:
- **First address:** Small apartment building. Neighbor answers.
- Abby: "I'm looking for Mr. Rodriguez?"
- Neighbor, sad: "He passed. Two weeks ago. Cancer."
- Abby: "I'm so sorry. Was he sick long?"
- Neighbor: "Six months, maybe. Went downhill fast. Strange thing—he barely went to the doctor. Kept saying he was fine until he wasn't."
- **Second address:** Hospice facility. Receptionist checks list.
- Receptionist: "Ms. Tran is in palliative care. Family only."
- Abby: "Can you tell me how long she's been ill?"
- Receptionist: "Stage four lung cancer. She's been here three months."
- Abby thanks her, leaves
- **Third address:** Run-down house. A woman answers, looks exhausted.
- Abby: "I'm looking for Michael Foster?"
- Woman: "That's my husband. What's this about?"
- Abby: "Wellness check from the clinic."
- Woman's face hardens: "Wellness check? He's dying. Liver failure. The clinic didn't do shit for him."
- Abby: "Which nurse did he see?"
- Woman: "I don't know. Some nurse with fancy nails. Didn't care, just rushed him through."
- **In the car, Abby calls Eddie and Baxter (video call):**
- Abby, shaken: "Two are dead. One's in hospice. One's dying at home."
- Eddie: "Jesus."
- Abby: "According to Baxter's records, these patients had minimal medical history. Almost no prescriptions. Nothing."
- Eddie: "But they're dying?"
- Abby: "Or already dead. This doesn't make sense. Your patients are healthy but have extensive records. Mine are dying but have no records."
- Baxter: "That's completely backwards."
- Abby: "Unless someone's hiding what they did to the sick patients and inventing treatments for the healthy ones."
- Eddie: "Insurance fraud for the healthy ones—billing Medicare for treatments they don't need."
- Abby: "But what about the dying patients? Why hide their records?"
- Long silence.
- Baxter: "Maybe because they did something wrong. Something that made them sick."

Turn:
Pattern is clear now but deeply disturbing. Healthy patients over-billed, dying patients have hidden records.

Button:
Abby: "One of the wives mentioned a nurse with fancy nails."
Eddie: "That's specific."
Abby: "We need to look at the nurse records. See if there's a pattern there too."

- Doogan caddies for Mara
- Brenda has genuinely improved over the week - noticeably better swings
- Mara notices: "Wait, did you actually take lessons this week?"
- Brenda, sheepish: "I watched YouTube videos in my hotel room. I didn't want to let you down."
- Mara1is touched. Gives her a genuine tip that helps immediately.
- Marcus is ridiculous as always but everyone's enjoying it
- The scramble format lets Brenda contribute meaningfully
- **Mara is joking on the course:** "Brenda, if you keep improving, I'm hiring you as MY coach."
- Gallery laughs. Mara plays to it, smiling, clearly enjoying herself.
- Mara and Doogan's teamwork is clicking perfectly - and the flirting is obvious

- "I forgot what it feels like to just... enjoy golf."
- Brenda, tearing up: "Thank you for being patient with me. My daughter's going to be so proud."
- Media everywhere - they're eating it up. Mara Kingsley is fun now.

Turn:
Mara has fully transformed. Open, warm, funny. Jake watching knows this is exactly what sponsors need to see.

Button:
Jake on phone with Eddie: "She's joking with the gallery. She hugged Brenda on the 18th green. I've got three voicemails from potential sponsors already."
Eddie: "Three? That's fast."
Jake: "Your guy is a miracle worker. Whatever you're paying him, double it."

## **10. Thursday Afternoon — "Martinez Returns the Earpiece"**
**Day:** Thursday afternoon (immediately after Pro-Am Round 2)  
**Location:** Hidden Hills parking lot

Purpose:
Increase tension. Show Martinez is actively investigating Doogan. Remind audience of murder investigation thread.

How it plays:
- Doogan walking to parking lot after Pro-Am round ends. Exhausted but satisfied—Mara played well.
- Baxter in Doogan's earpiece: "Good round. Mara's press was excellent."
- Martinez appears from behind a car. "Mr. Andrews. You've been a little hard to find."
- Doogan tenses. "Detective. Didn't know I was lost."
- Martinez pulls evidence bag from pocket—the earpiece from Episode 2. "Lab's done with this. Couldn't link it to the murder. Thought you might want it back."
- Doogan takes it carefully. "Thanks, I guess."
- Martinez examines him. "High-end surveillance equipment. Doesn't look like something from Radio Shack."
- Baxter's voice in Doogan's other earpiece, confused: "What's Radio Shack?"
- Doogan: "We do consulting work. Sometimes we need to communicate on job sites."
- Martinez watches him. "So, Mr. Andrews. Auction winner turned caddy? That's quite the prize package."
- Doogan: "Just trying to pay rent, like everyone else."
- Martinez: "Right. That building you live in is expensive. I've noticed your rent is probably high." Beat. "Not to mention your friend Eddie Palmer's business expenses. Consulting must be lucrative."
- Doogan keeps his face neutral but realizes Martinez has been digging.
- Martinez: "There's more to you than you're letting on. Not sure if it's tied to Annabelle's death but something is off. And I'll figure it out."
- He taps the evidence bag in Doogan's hand. "And Mr. Andrews? I told you not to leave town."
- Doogan: "I didn't. You found me, didn't you? I wasn't that far away."
- Martinez studies him, then nods. "Stay close, Mr. Andrews. I'll be watching."
- Martinez walks away. Doogan exhales, drops the earpiece in a trash can.
- Doogan, quietly to his earpiece: "Eddie, we need Baxter to update the Martinez file."
- Baxter's voice: "Already on it."

Turn:
Doogan realizes Martinez is building a file on him—and Eddie. The investigation isn't going away.

Button:
Doogan's phone buzzes. Text from Mara: "Dinner tonight? My treat. You earned it."
He looks back at Martinez's car driving away, then at the text. Two worlds colliding.

**Day:** Thursday evening (after Pro-Am Round 2)  
**Location:** Clubhouse restaurant

Purpose:
Deepen Doogan/Mara connection. Show her vulnerability about Alex. Emotional scene.

How it plays:
- Evening. Clubhouse restaurant, mostly empty. Mara is eating alone, scrolling through photos of Alex on her phone.
- Doogan appears. "Mind if I join you, or is this a solo brooding session?"
- Mara laughs despite herself. "Brooding is a strong word. I prefer 'strategic reflection.'"
- They talk. She's playing well but feels guilty—this is the longest she's been away from Alex.
- Doogan asks about her parents. Mara opens up about growing up at Kapalua, her dad the groundskeeper, learning golf on one of the world's best courses.
- She mentions Alex is there now. "He loves it. Runs around the course like I did. My dad's teaching him."
- A beat of vulnerability: "Sometimes I wonder if I should just stay there. Give up the tour. Be a normal mom."
- Doogan: "What would Alex want?"
- Mara thinks. "He'd want me to win. Even at three, he's competitive. Gets it from me."
- Her phone buzzes. Video from her mother: Alex in pajamas at sunset, waving at the phone with the ocean behind him.
- Mara watches it twice. Doogan doesn't rush her.
- Mara: "My mom sends these every night. So I don't miss bedtime."
- Doogan: "Your parents sound amazing."
- Mara looks at Doogan—really looks. "You're weirdly good at this. Talking, I mean."
- Doogan: "I've had practice."

Turn:
Mara is starting to trust Doogan—and maybe feeling something more.

Button:
Mara: "Same time tomorrow? I could use the company." 
Doogan nods. She doesn't know she just asked a con man on a date.

## **12. Thursday Night — "The Nancy Connection"**
**Day:** Thursday night  
**Location:** Video call between Eddie/Abby/Baxter

Purpose:
Team puts both patterns together. Identify Nancy as common link. Recall nail salon detail and make plan.

How it plays:
- Video call. All three on screen. Baxter has been digging through remaining files.
- Eddie: "So we have healthy patients being billed for fake treatments, and dying patients with hidden records."
- Abby: "The question is: who connects them?"
- Baxter: "I've been looking at the partial nurse assignments in the files that didn't get scrubbed."
- He pulls up data: "The healthy patients—Mrs. Chen, Mrs. Yamamoto, Mr. Peterson—they all saw different nurses. Patricia, Linda, Grace, Marcus."
- Abby: "Different nurses. No pattern."
- Baxter: "Right. But the patients with minimal records—the ones who are sick or dead? I cross-referenced with shift schedules."
- He highlights a name: "They all saw the same nurse. Nancy Weller."
- Eddie leans forward: "All of them?"
- Baxter: "Every single one. Mr. Rodriguez, Ms. Tran, Michael Foster—Nancy was their assigned nurse."
- Abby: "The wife mentioned a nurse with fancy nails."
- Eddie: "So Nancy's seeing the sick patients, and their records are being hidden."
- Baxter: "And she's been at the clinic for fifteen years. Long enough to know how the system works."
- Abby: "What do we know about her?"
- Baxter pulls up basic info: "Nancy Weller. 47 years old. Head nurse. Lives in Culver City."
- Eddie: "Head nurse. So she has access to everything."
- Abby: "We need to know more about her. Who she is, how she lives, what she's hiding."
- Eddie: "But we can't just walk into the clinic. Martinez has seen me there. And Abby, Nancy already spotted you."
- Long pause. Everyone thinking.
- Eddie suddenly remembers: "Wait. When we were staking out the clinic a couple weeks ago, there was a nail salon down the street. I went in once to use their bathroom, and the nail tech looked at me like I was casing the place."
- Abby sits up: "Nail salon?"
- Eddie: "Two blocks from the clinic. Kim's Nails."
- Abby, recalling: "Wait. When I ran into Nancy at the clinic Sunday, she had really nice nails. I mentioned it—elaborate nail art, expensive looking."
- Baxter: "That's Nancy Weller. The same nurse."
- Eddie: "A nurse making $85K a year doesn't get work like that done at a strip mall unless she's a regular."
- Baxter: "And if she's a regular, the nail tech probably knows things."
- Abby grins: "Perfect. I'm going undercover."
- Baxter: "What's the angle?"
- Abby: "I'm getting my nails done tomorrow after the tournament. And I'm going to ask about Nancy."

Turn:
Nancy identified as key person of interest AND they have a plan to get intel on her.

Button:
Eddie: "Be careful. If she's involved in this, she's dangerous."
Abby: "Don't worry. I speak fluent nail salon."
Baxter: "I'll keep digging into her background. See what I can find before you go in."

## **13. Friday — "The Professional Exhibition"**
**Day:** Friday morning/afternoon  
**Location:** Hidden Hills Golf Course - 18 holes

Purpose:
Tournament climax. Mara vs Candy. Weather gambit on 18th hole. Mara wins and shows personality.

- Candy also playing well - but she's all business, serious
- They're paired together for back 9 as leaders

- Eddie: "The plan is working."
- Jake: "No. It's better than the plan. She's actually happy."
- 18th hole: Par 5, 520 yards, dogleg right with tall trees on right side
- Baxter in Doogan's earpiece: "High-pressure weather system over the course. Air density is higher than normal."
- Doogan to Eddie on comms: "What does that mean?"
- Baxter: "Ball won't carry as far as players expect. Especially anyone used to Arizona's elevation and dry air."
- Doogan pieces it together. Candy is from Scottsdale. She's going to overestimate her drive.
- At the tee, Mara looks at the flag, calculating. Candy's already decided—she's going for it.
- Mara asks Doogan: "What do you think? I can reach it in two."
- Doogan, quietly: "Lay up. Trust me."
- Mara studies his face. She's learned to trust him this week. Nods.

- Candy goes aggressive, powerhouse drive
- Candy's ball doesn't carry like she expected - clips the trees, ends up in deep rough

## **15. Friday Evening — "Kim's Nails"**
**Day:** Friday evening (shortly after Scene 14 call)  
**Location:** Kim's Nails salon

Purpose:
Abby goes undercover at nail salon. Gets dirt on Nancy. Baxter runs background. Episode climax.

How it plays:
- Abby enters Kim's Nails. Small salon, Kim is the owner/main tech.
- Abby sits in Kim's chair, friendly and chatty
- Gets the conversation flowing - compliments Kim's work on other customers
- Abby casually: "I saw a woman with the most amazing nails earlier today. Your work? Really intricate design, lots of detail."
- Kim lights up: "Oh! Probably Nancy. She's one of my regulars. Always wants the most elaborate designs."
- Abby: "She seemed interesting."
- Kim lowers her voice, glances around: "Between us? She's kind of a nightmare."
- Abby raises an eyebrow, encouraging
- Kim continues: "Always pays cash - never tips well though. Complains about everything. But she wants the best work, so..." Kim shrugs.
- Abby: "She works at that clinic on Maple, right? I think I saw her there."
- Kim nods: "Head nurse. Been there forever. Acts like she owns the place."
- Abby, fishing: "She must do well. Those nails aren't cheap."
- Kim laughs: "Girl, her nails are just the start. She's had work done." Gestures to her own face. "Lots of work. Botox, fillers, probably a lift or two."
- Abby: "Good for her."
- Kim: "Expensive though. I don't know how she affords it on a nurse's salary."
- Meanwhile: Baxter is listening in via Abby's phone, running background checks
- Baxter types away, finding financial records, cross-referencing
- Kim finishes Abby's nails. Abby tips generously (showing contrast to Nancy).
- Outside, Abby calls Eddie and Baxter from her car

Turn:
They have intel on Nancy - expensive lifestyle, lots of plastic surgery, pays cash, living beyond her means.

Button (In the car call):
Abby: "So Nancy's living way beyond what a head nurse should make. Expensive plastic surgery, designer lifestyle, but stays off the radar by paying cash."
Baxter on speaker: "I pulled her financials. Her official income is $85K a year. But she owns a condo worth $600K, drives a Mercedes, and has no debt. The math doesn't work."
Eddie: "She's getting money from somewhere else."
Abby: "The clinic. Whatever they're running, she's making bank from it."
Eddie: "So how do we prove it? We can't just walk in there."
Abby pauses, then grins: "No. But I know someone who can get close to her."
Eddie: "Who?"
Abby: "Think about it. Nancy's single, bitter, expensive tastes, loves attention. She's two procedures away from full muppet mode but thinks she's hot. We need someone charming who can make her feel special."
Eddie catches on: "Oh no."
Abby: "Oh yes. Doogan."
Eddie: "He just finished a week-long job. He's going to hate this."
Abby: "He's going to love it. He just doesn't know it yet."

## Episode Notes

**A-Plot/B-Plot Balance:**
- Total: 14 scenes (combined Scenes 12 & 14)
- A-plot (Mara): Scenes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13 (8 scenes)
- B-plot (Investigation): Scenes 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14 (6 scenes)
- B-plot scenes are efficient - some conveyed through dialog/calls rather than full dramatization

**Key Story Beats:**
- Doogan's cover is "auction winner" - fits charity event perfectly
- Mara's arc: Wound tight → Small cracks (Monday) → Starting to trust (Wednesday) → Emotionally open (Thursday) → Playing loose (Saturday) → Victory with personality
- Investigation arc: Patient visits → Pattern emerges → Nancy identified → Visual confirmation → Nail salon intel → Setup for Doogan
- Tournament climax happens BEFORE nail salon discovery (as requested)
- Episode ends with Abby proposing Doogan investigate Nancy

**Investigation Details:**
- Scene 2: Abby attempts to access hard copy files at clinic, encounters Nancy, mentions nice nails (detail goes unnoticed)
- Scene 6: Abby visits healthy patient (Mrs. Chen) with extensive records that don't match reality
- Eddie visits Mrs. Yamamoto, ends up helping with bunions (comic relief but also confirms pattern)
- Scene 8: Abby visits three patients with minimal records—two dead, one dying, one in hospice
- Pattern emerges: healthy patients over-billed, sick/dying patients have hidden records
- Scene 12: Baxter cross-references nurse assignments—Nancy Weller identified. Team stuck until Eddie remembers nail salon, Abby recalls Nancy's nice nails from Scene 2. Plan formed.
- Scene 14: Nail salon investigation reveals Nancy living beyond her means
- Setup for Doogan to investigate Nancy in Episode 4

**Nancy Arc:**
- Scene 2: Introduced as territorial nurse who catches Abby, nice nails mentioned casually
- Scene 12: Identified as connecting all dying patients through data analysis; nail detail recalled, becomes key to investigation plan
- Scene 14: Full intel gathered—expensive lifestyle, plastic surgery, cash-only, doesn't tip
- Eddie's patients: Elderly, healthy, want to hang out (conveyed through dialog)
- Abby's patients: Minimal records, sick/dying
- Abby only team member not seen by Martinez at clinic
