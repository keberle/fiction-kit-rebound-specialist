# Episode Outline
---
**Title:** The Professional Golfer
**Episode:** 3
**Theme:** Doogan is realizing he's in over his head so a weekend distraction is a good thing.  Doogan uses this to remind himself that his job is important to the targets of his rebound jobs.  He's a good guy and he is doing a good thing.  The rebound is a female professional golfer who left the sport to have a child and is now trying to return as a single mom balancing the physical and emotional toll of trying to reclaim greatness on the LPGA circuit.

**Tournament:** SheLeads Golf Classic - week-long LPGA Pro-Am benefiting women's STEM scholarships. Rancho Palos Verdes, CA.
<!-- Reference: events/sheLeads-golf-classic.md for complete itinerary and format details -->

**Tournament Structure:**
- Sunday: Welcome reception, pairing announcement
- Monday: Practice day (driving range, short game, 9-hole fun round)
- Wednesday: Pro-Am Day 1 - Best Ball format, top 50% make cut
- Thursday: Pro-Am Day 2 - Scramble format, top 30% make cut  
- Friday: Pro-Am Day 3 - Modified Aggregate, top 20 teams qualify pros for Saturday
- Saturday: LPGA Professional Tournament (stroke play, pros only)

**Notes:** Mara and Candy both make it through Pro-Am cuts to Saturday's pro tournament. They're paired together as top seeds. On the 18th hole, Doogan (caddying) notices high-pressure weather system via Baxter. Realizes Candy (from Arizona) will overestimate drive distance. Advises Mara to lay up. Candy's ball clips trees, doesn't carry. Mara wins by one stroke. That 2010 US Open at Pebble Beach where Dustin Johnson's shots didn't carry the trees - same principle.

**Story Arc:** 
**A-Plot (Mara):** Week-long Pro-Am tournament. Mara paired with comedian Brenda Atwood. Doogan as substitute caddy. They barely survive Wednesday's cut (Best Ball), improve Thursday (Scramble), make Friday's cut (Modified Aggregate). Saturday pro tournament: Mara vs Candy, final 18th hole weather gambit, Mara wins. Shows personality in victory interview, sponsors call Jake.

**B-Plot (Investigation):** Parallel to tournament week. Before files disappeared, Baxter exported incomplete patient data - has names but not diagnoses or full records. Eddie and Abby divide list, visit patients undercover. Eddie keeps getting elderly patients who want to hang out (conveyed through dialog in group calls). Abby discovers pattern: patients with minimal medical history/prescriptions are dead or dying; patients with extensive medical history/prescriptions are healthy (some are even douchebags). Comparing notes: Eddie's patients saw different nurses, but the unusual patients all saw same nurse - Nancy. Abby tracks Nancy through distinctive nails to nail salon (Friday evening). Setup for Episode 4.

**Hook / Cold Open:** Monday morning - Mara shanks balls at driving range while distracted by video call with Alex in Hawaii. Doogan introduces himself, helps her hit clean shot.

**End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Friday evening after Pro-Am cuts announced - Abby at nail salon, grins at mirror: "Doogan is going to love this one."

---

## Episode Arc
- **Act 1 (Sunday-Monday):** Setup. Doogan takes Mara job, meets her at reception. Practice day builds chemistry. Baxter reveals incomplete patient data exported before deletion; Eddie/Abby divide list, start patient visits.
- **Act 2 (Tuesday-Thursday):** Complication. Pro-Am Days 1-2, Mara/Doogan bond through pressure. Eddie/Abby continue patient interviews (Eddie getting elderly patients who want company, Abby finding the pattern). They barely survive cuts but improving.
- **Act 3 (Friday-Saturday):** Climax. Pro-Am Day 3, emotional with Brenda, they make cut. Eddie/Abby compare notes - discover Nancy connection. Saturday pro tournament, weather gambit, Mara wins, shows personality. Abby tracks Nancy to nail salon, setup for next episode.

## **1. Cold Open — "Monday Morning - Driving Range"**
**Day:** Monday morning (Practice Day)  
**Location:** Terranea Golf Course driving range

Purpose:
Introduce Mara's emotional state—show how being separated from Alex fractures her focus. Doogan makes first impression.

How it plays:
- Early morning driving range. Mara sets up a ball, then her phone buzzes. Video call.
- She answers. Her son ALEX (3) appears on screen, excited. Her mother's voice: "Alex, say hi to Mommy!"
- Alex waves at the screen. "Hi Mama! Tutu made pancakes!" (Tutu = Hawaiian for grandmother)
- Mara smiles, but it's strained. "That's wonderful, baby. Are you being good for Tutu and Papa?"
- Her mother: "He's perfect. You focus on your tournament. We've got him."
- Alex waves. Call ends. Mara stares at the blank screen, missing home.
- She swings. Shanks it badly. Another. Worse.
- A man's voice: "You're collapsing your trailing elbow."
- Doogan is leaning against the fence, golf bag on his shoulder. He says it gently, like he's commenting on weather.
- Mara bristles. "Thanks. I'm aware."
- Doogan: "You're also gripping like you're trying to strangle something. Rough morning?"
- Mara exhales. "My son's back in Hawaii. First big tournament since I came back, and I can't even—" She stops herself. Why is she telling a stranger this?
- Doogan steps closer, not crowding. "Hit one more. But this time, pretend you're showing him how it's done. Like he's watching."
- Mara hesitates. Sets up. Swings. Pure contact. The ball sails.
- She stares at it, then back at Doogan.

Turn:
Mara realizes she hasn't hit a clean shot in weeks—and a stranger just unlocked something.

Button:
Doogan: "I'm Doogan. I'm your caddy this week while Jenny's away. And for what it's worth, your son is probably bragging about you to everyone at Kapalua right now."
Mara blinks. "How did you know about Kapalua?"
Doogan: "Your manager mentioned it. Jake speaks very highly of you."

- Brenda is warm, self-deprecating: "I should warn you, I'm terrible. But I promise to be entertainingly terrible."

- Mara watches them with thinly veiled disdain
- Doogan appears with champagne: "I'm guessing they're not your favorite people."

Turn:
The teams are set. The week begins. Mara is wound tight and about to spend five days with a caddy who might be a problem.

- Baxter pulled six patient files from the clinic system before whoever was deleting caught him.
- The files are incomplete—names, addresses, some medical notes, all flagged by Annabelle.

- Eddie wants to visit them all today. Abby points out that's insane.

- Eddie: "Why do you get to pick?"
- Abby: "Because you'll somehow give yourself the country club zip codes."

## **4. Country Club — "The Rebound Brief"**
**Day:** Sunday afternoon (before reception)  
**Location:** Terranea Clubhouse, private meeting room

Purpose:
Establish the job parameters and show Doogan's reluctance—he's not sure this one is ethical.

How it plays:
- Doogan meets the client: Mara's manager, Jake Townsend—mid-40s, practical, genuinely concerned.
- Jake explains: Mara was a three-time major champion before pregnancy. Took three years off. Been back two years, playing the best golf of her life but can't get sponsors because she comes across as cold in interviews.
- The job: help her relax, show her human side, make her marketable. Not romance (though that's fine), just connection.
- Doogan hesitates. "She's a single mom. You want me to manipulate her?"
- Jake: "I want you to remind her who she was before all the pressure. She's drowning, and her son needs her to succeed."
- Eddie (on phone, listening): "The money is very good, Doogan. And he's right—this helps her."
- Jake adds: "Her regular caddy is visiting family. You'll fill in as substitute. Gets you close."
- Doogan watches Mara on the practice green through the window—wound tight, isolated.

Turn:

Button:
"One rule: the son is off-limits. I'm not using a toddler to run a con."

- Abby: "I visited two patients. Different story. Both younger, minimal medical history according to what Baxter has."
- Eddie: "And?"
- Abby: "One's in hospice. The other looked terrible—thin, weak. Lots of pill bottles but wouldn't let me see them."
- Baxter: "That's... odd. Why would healthy patients with no history suddenly be that sick?"
- Abby: "Unless they're NOT healthy. Unless someone's been falsifying records."

Button:
Eddie: "We need more data points. Keep visiting tomorrow."
