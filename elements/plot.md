- Clinic falsifies medical exams to show terminal patients as healthy.
- Pharmacy issues prescriptions under beneficiary names to hide the patients’ true conditions.
- Fake insurance agency submits applications to major insurers or reinsurers using falsified records.
- Investors pay the premiums and are listed as beneficiaries.
- When the patient dies, payouts go to the investors, who kick back money to the clinic/insurance front.
- The twist is that the fake insurance company also has a fake medical billing company that is sending extra bills to the investors, which have to be paid to hide the terminal patient's condition...but now they're scamming both the big insurance companies and the investors

This is a hybrid of:
- Healthcare fraud
- Insurance fraud
- STOLI schemes
All of which are real.

Theta Health = a fraudulent MGA + TPA hybrid
Pacific Point Clinic = clinic that has been investigated for painkiller prescriptions but now serves as the medical front for fake life insurance
Neighborhood Pharmacy - issues the prescriptions in the name of the investors/beneficiaries so the insurance companies can't audit the prescriptions and connect them to the patients
Emergence Medical Billing - fake medical billing company
