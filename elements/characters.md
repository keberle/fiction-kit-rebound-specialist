# Character Index: The Rebound Specialist

## Main Characters

### Doogan Andrews
<!-- Reference: characters/doogan-andrews.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/doogan-andrews.jpg -->
The main character and the protagonist of our story. The narrative is written in third‑person limited, closely aligned to Doogan’s perceptions.

### Eddie Palmer
<!-- Reference: characters/eddie-palmer.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/eddie-palmer.jpg -->
Doogan's best friend and the manager and agent for the Rebound business.  He works out of his home and he's been Doogan's best friend since college.  Eddie is also the person who came up with the business idea in college.

### Abby Palmer
<!-- Reference: characters/abby-palmer.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/abby-palmer.jpg -->
Abby is Eddie's wife and a form of antagonist for both characters in that she is constantly pushing their buttons, especially about the business.  But Abby secretly is intrigued by their line of work and will jump at a chance to help, even if she pretends like its annoying and inconvenient.  She has known both men since college.

### Rodney Baxter
<!-- Reference: characters/rodney-baxter.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/rodney-baxter.jpg -->
Known to everyone except his mother as "Baxter", he's an 18 year old technology prodigy who graduated high school (for the school's sanity) at 15, entered college at 16 but dropoped out due to social adjustment issues.  Give him enough time and he'd hack his way into big trouble so working for Eddie and Doogan helps keep him out of trouble and he idolizes both men for their social skills, which he lacks.

### Detective Paul Martinez
<!-- Reference: characters/paul-martinez.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/paul-martinez.jpg -->
Detective Paul Martinez is assigned the homicide investigation in episode 1 and serves as another form of antagonist for Doogan as he tries to solve the crime.  Highly ethical but with a deep streak of sarcasm and irony, he's a deadpan foil for Doogan's charming sense of humor.

### Hank Stilman
Hank is the usual, back of the phone book attorney.  He'd be an "ambulance chaser" but then he'd have to use enough energy to chase one.  As a low end defense attorney he gets just enough business stumbling through his door to pay his bills but that's pretty much all he really cares about.

## Episode 1

### Claire Rogers
The prologue rebound target, dumping Doogan in the opening scene.  She's smart, beautiful, in her early 40's and not lacking in the confidence and effortless beauty she has been blessed with.   Although Doogan knows that she is an attorney and that she works for the government, he doesn't know much more about her work than that.  He spent more time getting to know here as a person.

**Vehicle:** Silver BMW sedan *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 2)*

### Sebastian LeClere
<!-- Reference: characters/villain.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/villain.jpg -->
Sebastian LeClere is hiring Eddie and Doogan to provide a convenient rebound for the receptionist at his medical billing company.  He's not married but he doesn't want a messy break up impacting company culture.  But when Doogan asks some basic information about her to help with the background on her, he doesn't seem to know some details like here favorite coffee or what she does on weekends.  Eddie seems to dismiss it as clearly she's just a hook up for the CEO and he's too self centered to bother learning those details but Doogan isn't as sure about that.

### Annabelle Anders
<!-- Portrait: characters/annabelle-anders.jpg -->
The receptionist that Sebastian hires Eddie and Doogan to rebound.  She's a 5' 2", brunette who is definitely more cute than sexy.  She's young and lives up to many of the stereotypes of her generation, excessive social media and some superficial habits but she's smarter than most and already frustrated with the young men in her age group who simply cannot keep up with her wit.  But in Doogan she sees someone who check that 6's (6 foot tall, 6 figures, 6 pack) and his quick wit is an unlikely combination.  Is he that less than 1% of guys who really achieve all of that and can keep up with Annabelle?  It too tempting for her not to find out, even if it means taking a chance and trusting a stranger.

### Detective Peter Finch
Detective Finch accompanies Martines the first time he "magically" appears to interogate Doogan.  He's an older, more worn down police officer who assumes anyone who isn't a cop is probably guilty of something.

## Episode 2

### Thomas Billings
When called "Tom" will correct people that its "Thomas".  He's a very successful but very straight laced accountant with his own accounting firm, where he is managing partner.  He's annoyed that this rebound thing even exists let along having to hire them to do it.

### Silvia Billings
Career stay at home mom with clearly expensive tastes.  Fits the Southern Califonia trophy wife stereotype to the letter.  She's sweet and self abosrbed.  She is the one who heard about Doogan and Eddie's business from a friend who had paid for Doogan to help make the dismissal of a mistress less complicated for a dear friend of hers.  (her characterization and not Doogan's but he doesn't correct her)  She simply does not want Cheryl, Gabby's older sister to ruin her big day, especially since all of Sylvia's friends will be at the wedding and it has to be perfect.

### Gabby Billings
<!-- Portrait: characters/gabby-billings.jpg -->
Thomas and Silvia's youngest daughter and the bride at an upcoming wedding.

### Brad Levitt
Gabby's groom and soon to be newest member of the Billings family.

### Cheryl Billings
<!-- Portrait: characters/cheryl-billings.jpg -->
Gabby's older sister, age 32. Works in corporate finance—contract negotiation, very dry and boring work. She is the target of the rebound. Brad Levitt was her boyfriend first—they dated for six months before she broke up with him because he was "the most boring human on the planet." Three months later, Brad got engaged to Cheryl's younger sister Gabby, which her mother Sylvia finds thrilling (Gabby has always been the favorite, and Brad's family has money). Cheryl is frustrated that Gabby is getting married before her and that her family treats her like a "problem" for being thirty-two and single. She sees a therapist regularly. Sharp, competitive, wounded beneath the surface—her competitiveness during the scavenger hunt isn't just about winning, it's about proving something. *(Expanded in Episode 2, Scene 10)*

**What Cheryl Knows About Doogan (Cover Story):**
- Believes he's a "family friend" invited to the wedding
- Suspects her parents arranged for him to keep her company/behave during wedding weekend
- Does NOT know he's paid/hired
- Does NOT know this is his profession
- Allowed to be skeptical about the "family friend" story being a setup, but never discovers the business transaction

**Home:** Nice two-story house in an expensive neighborhood of Pacific Point—not ostentatious, but clearly successful. Perfectly landscaped (professional maintenance), modern professional aesthetic. More urban professional style than suburban family home—reflects her corporate finance career and single lifestyle. Similar quality to Palmer residence but smaller scale. *(Established in Episode 2, Scene 14)*

### Terry Tamborino
<!-- Reference: characters/terry-tamborino.md -->
The Billings wedding planner. Openly flamboyant, theatrical, operates at 150% intensity (resembles Nathan Lane in energy and style). Perfectionist who's been planning weddings for twenty years and treats each one like opening night on Broadway. Doesn't know about the rebound work—just grateful Cheryl has someone to keep her from "going full Cheryl" during the wedding weekend.

### Jillian (bridesmaid)
Jillian is the perfect stereotype of a wannabe SoCal (southern california) social media influencer.  Everything in her life is built for FOMO photo and video opportunities.  She's done make up and shampoo GRWM (get ready with me), popular dance and lip sync videos, faked private jet getaway weekend photo bombs, even tried doing vintage found clothes videos, resulting in an unfortunate trespassing incident at a hollywood hills garage sale.  But her desperate attempts at social media clout giving her compliments like "Oh, Jillian, you look great...like you'll be 21 forever.", hinting that her tastes mirror that now bankrupt store franchise Forever 21.  And her boyfriend is largely for show, like some live action Ken doll.  Cheryl is pretty sure she doesn't even have sex with him and that he's in the closet but also wants the social media clout.  He's worthless though, not even worth learning his name.

## Episode 3

Powerhouse drive but weak short game - wins tournaments anyway because her drives get her close enough. Wears short skirts (pays LPGA fines), creates golf lifestyle content.

### Jake Townsend
<!-- Reference: characters/jake-townsend.md -->
Mara's sports manager/agent, age 46. Has managed Mara for 13 years (since she turned pro). Runs boutique sports management firm in Orange County. Married with two high school kids.

### Jenny Traverse
<!-- Reference: characters/jenny-traverse.md -->
Mara's regular professional caddy, age 38. Has caddied for Mara for 5 years, knows her game inside and out. From Massachusetts, lives in Florida. Jake asked her to visit family during Pro-Am so Doogan could fill in as caddy and get close to Mara. Feels guilty about deception but agreed because she's worried about Mara's stress level. Cover story: mother's minor surgery (mother is actually fine).

### Brenda Atwood
<!-- Reference: characters/brenda-atwood.md -->
Comedic actress, age 42, former SNL cast member, current sitcom star. Paired with Mara for Pro-Am. Genuinely terrible at golf but took 6 weeks of lessons. Self-deprecating humor, warm and genuine. Doing Pro-Am for women's empowerment/STEM cause (has 10-year-old daughter). Makes Mara smile despite herself. Provides contrast to Candy/Tilly - shows how to be funny without being annoying.

### Tilly London
<!-- Reference: characters/tilly-london.md -->
Reality TV star, age 25, star of "London Calling" show about her life as influencer. 5.6M Instagram followers. Paired with Candy for Pro-Am. Essentially zero golf skills. Everything is content for her reality show cameras. Vapid, self-absorbed, treats everyone as props. More annoying than Candy. She and Candy together create insufferable influencer bubble. Constant target for Mara and Doogan's bonding through shared eye-rolls.

### Marcus
Brenda Atwood's bumbling, dramatic male assistant. Provides comic relief during the Pro-Am. Initially attempts to be Brenda's caddy wearing a caddy vest with her name on it, but the clubs are too heavy. Relieved when Winston takes over caddy duties, allowing Marcus to focus on capturing social media content with his phone. Over-the-top reactions and constant phone filming. Age mid-20s.

### Winston Reilly
Elderly Black man, late 60s, who Doogan recruits as Brenda's caddy for the Pro-Am. Frequents a nearby 9-hole municipal course. Wears country club casual attire with golf spikes. Uses a PGA-legal hand cart for clubs. Decades of golf experience have taught him conservative, efficient play—doesn't have 300-yard drives anymore, stays tactical. Short game specialist. Perfect strategic match for Brenda's needs. Shoots Doogan a look when introduced as "old friend" (they just met) but doesn't contradict him publicly. Embarrassed by attention and praise. Has a wife waiting at home. *(Established in Episode 3, Scenes 7-8)*

## Episode 4

### Nancy Crawford (aka Nurse Nancy)
She has had a ridiculous amount of plastic surgery and is a genuinely horrible person. She's attractive but in an edgy way. To pay for her plastic surgery, she has been doing something illegal they suspect but she's evasive about what. She does let it slip that they have a deal with the nearby pharmacy to get any prescription she needs in any name. Letting the "any name" part slip is the mistake.

**Exclusive Exam Room:** Nancy has her own exam room (Exam Room 1) at the clinic with no security camera coverage—unusual for the facility. She only sees certain patients there, though the scheduling notes use coded references that aren't immediately clear. The clinic has cameras throughout public areas and hallways, but Nancy's exam room and the corridor leading to it have no surveillance. *(Established in Episode 3, Scene 2)*

**Physical Details:** Blonde, late forties but maintains appearance through visible plastic surgery. Professional French-tip manicures (expensive). Wears tailored scrubs. Lives beyond apparent means for nurse's salary. *(Established in Episode 3, Scene 2)*
