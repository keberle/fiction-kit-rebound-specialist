## Main Characters

### Doogan Andrews
<!-- Reference: characters/doogan-andrews.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/doogan-andrews.jpg -->
The main character and the protagonist of our story. The narrative is written in third‑person limited, closely aligned to Doogan’s perceptions.

### Eddie Palmer
<!-- Reference: characters/eddie-palmer.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/eddie-palmer.jpg -->
Doogan's best friend and the manager and agent for the Rebound business.  He works out of his home and he's been Doogan's best friend since college.  Eddie is also the person who came up with the business idea in college.

### Abby Palmer
<!-- Reference: characters/abby-palmer.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/abby-palmer.jpg -->
Abby is Eddie's wife and a form of antagonist for both characters in that she is constantly pushing their buttons, especially about the business.  But Abby secretly is intrigued by their line of work and will jump at a chance to help, even if she pretends like its annoying and inconvenient.  She has known both men since college.

### Rodney Baxter
<!-- Reference: characters/rodney-baxter.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/rodney-baxter.jpg -->
Known to everyone except his mother as "Baxter", he's an 18 year old technology prodigy who graduated high school (for the school's sanity) at 15, entered college at 16 but dropoped out due to social adjustment issues.  Give him enough time and he'd hack his way into big trouble so working for Eddie and Doogan helps keep him out of trouble and he idolizes both men for their social skills, which he lacks.

### Detective Paul Martinez
<!-- Reference: characters/paul-martinez.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/paul-martinez.jpg -->
Detective Paul Martinez is assigned the homicide investigation in episode 1 and serves as another form of antagonist for Doogan as he tries to solve the crime.  Highly ethical but with a deep streak of sarcasm and irony, he's a deadpan foil for Doogan's charming sense of humor.

### Hank Stilman
Hank is the usual, back of the phone book attorney.  He'd be an "ambulance chaser" but then he'd have to use enough energy to chase one.  As a low end defense attorney he gets just enough business stumbling through his door to pay his bills but that's pretty much all he really cares about.

## Episode 1

### Claire Rogers
The prologue rebound target, dumping Doogan in the opening scene.  She's smart, beautiful, in her early 40's and not lacking in the confidence and effortless beauty she has been blessed with.   Although Doogan knows that she is an attorney and that she works for the government, he doesn't know much more about her work than that.  He spent more time getting to know here as a person.

### Sebastian LeClere
<!-- Reference: characters/villain.md -->
<!-- Portrait: characters/villain.jpg -->
Sebastian LeClere is hiring Eddie and Doogan to provide a convenient rebound for the receptionist at his medical billing company.  He's not married but he doesn't want a messy break up impacting company culture.  But when Doogan asks some basic information about her to help with the background on her, he doesn't seem to know some details like here favorite coffee or what she does on weekends.  Eddie seems to dismiss it as clearly she's just a hook up for the CEO and he's too self centered to bother learning those details but Doogan isn't as sure about that.

### Annabelle Anders
<!-- Portrait: characters/annabelle-anders.jpg -->
The receptionist that Sebastian hires Eddie and Doogan to rebound.  She's young and lives up to some of the stereotypes of her generation, excessive social media and some superficial habits but he's smarter than most and already frustrated with the young men in her age group who simply cannot keep up with her wit.  But in Doogan she sees someone who check that 6's (6 foot tall, 6 figures, 6 pack) and his quick wit is an unlikely combination.  Is he that less than 1% of guys who really achieve all of that and can keep up with Annabelle?  It too tempting for her not to find out, even if it means taking a chance and trusting a stranger.

### Detective Peter Finch
Detective Finch accompanies Martines the first time he "magically" appears to interogate Doogan.  He's an older, more worn down police officer who assumes anyone who isn't a cop is probably guilty of something.

## Episode 2

### Thomas Billings
When called "Tom" will correct people that its "Thomas".  He's a very successful but very straight laced accountant with his own accounting firm, where he is managing partner.  He's annoyed that this rebound thing even exists let along having to hire them to do it.

### Silvia Billings
Career stay at home mom with clearly expensive tastes.  Fits the Southern Califonia trophy wife stereotype to the letter.  She's sweet and self abosrbed.  She is the one who heard about Doogan and Eddie's business from a friend who had paid for Doogan to help make the dismissal of a mistress less complicated for a dear friend of hers.  (her characterization and not Doogan's but he doesn't correct her)  She simply does not want Cheryl, Gabby's older sister to ruin her big day, especially since all of Sylvia's friends will be at the wedding and it has to be perfect.

### Gabby Billings
<!-- Portrait: characters/gabby-billings.jpg -->
Thomas and Silvia's youngest daughter and the bride at an upcoming wedding.

### Brad Levitt
Gabby's groom and soon to be newest member of the Billings family.

### Cheryl Billings
<!-- Portrait: characters/cheryl-billings.jpg -->
Gabby's older sister.  She is the target of the rebound.  It turns out, Brad was her boyfriend first and she dumped him because he was so boring but she didn't intend for her little sister to snag him afterwards.  She's also very annoyed that Gabby is getting married before her, since she is the older sister.

### Terry Tamborino
Terry is the Billings wedding planner.  He's openly flamboyant and a more than a little effeminate and he doesn't know about the rebound.  He's just glad Cheryl has someone to keep her distracted so she doesn't go "full Cheryl" during the wedding weekend events.  He is an aderal fueled, multi-tasking wedding planning savant.  And he thinks Doogan is too good looking to be straight but he's too busy planning the wedding of the season to spend anymore time on that.

## Episode 3

### Mara Kingsley
Mara is an aging professional woman golfer on the LPGA tour.

### Candace (Candy) Hoover
Candy Hoover is a social media sensation.  She's a cute blonde with a curvy posterior that she's not afraid to show off, even wearing skirts that are too short based on LPGA rules and just pays the fines.  Its worth it to be the top "thirst trap" on the tour and her number of followers and endorsements show it.

### Brenda Atwood
Brenda is a comedic actress who has been paired up with Mara for the Pro Am tournament. She's sweet and extremely funny but not much of a golfer.  She took some lessons leading up to the tournament but she's still struggling.

### Tilly London
Tilly is the star of a reality TV show about her life as an influencer so it makes sense that she's paired up with Candy Hoover.  Together they are an influencing powerhouse and beyond annoying.  They are a constant target for the jabs of Mara and Doogan.

## Episode 4

### Nancy Crawford (aka Nurse Nancy)
She has had a ridiculous amount of plastic surgery and is a genuinely horrible person.  She's attractive but in an edgy way.  To pay for her plastic surgery, she has been doing something illegal they suspect but she's evasive about what.  She does let it slip that they have a deal with the nearby pharmacy to get any prescription she needs in any name.  Letting the "any name" part slip is the mistake.

## Episode 5

### Arthur Sanders
One of the married couple who own the pharmacy.  Arthur handles the business side, the storefront and registers and all of the pharmacy's books.  He's a sweet old guy in his 60's.

### Ellen Sanders
Ellen is the wife of Arthur and the primary pharmacist of the business.  She's also a sweet woman in her 60's.

### Ellie Sanders
Named "Ellen" after her grandmother, she's just finished pharmacy tech school and is helping her grandparents with their business.  Her friends call her "Ellie" for short.

## Episode 10

### Curtis Tremble
The wine label forger from the documentary "The Wine Scam" that Abby remembers from late night streaming.  In the video, he and his partner were attempting to take every day wines, relabel and bottle them and sell them to wealthy wine investors.
