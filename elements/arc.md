- They finally track Annabelle to a real employer and go check it out
- While sitting outside of the clinic, Martinez pops out of nowhere with questions for Doogan (Martinez + partner)
- It takes the whole team to finally get enough information about the clinic for Baxter to track down some information.
- Baxter hacks the clinic's digital patient files and finds a recent file that Annabelle has flagged that mentioned a patient diagnosis that is incorrect but before Baxter can copy the file, its wiped out
*hinting at something bigger*

- Abby goes to visit one of the patients but sees medications with a different name on them
- Martinez is stalled by Eddie about Doogan's whereabouts but its not working too well
- Abby finds Nurse Nancy based on her distinct nails at a popular nail salon and bribes the nail tech for information on Nancy...and she's a real bitch  "Oh, Doogan's gonna love this one"

### Episode 4
- Doogan pursues Nancy but she's not an easy mark at all
- Martinez has more questions for Doogan but this time no partner ("That constant partner nonsense is for movies and tv shows, in the real world we work in small teams and I'm the primary on this case")
- The team continues to investigate the patients they can find
- Martinez finds Eddie at a sports bar meeting with a potential client and questions him more
- Nancy tells Doogan that they routinely issue prescriptions in other names for less than scrupulous reasons
- Doogan wakes up next to Nancy, dead
*now its getting scary*

### Episode 5
- Doogan once again is sitting in the exact same holding cell waiting for Eddie to get him out but Martinez comes to visit him
- The team thinks its a pharmaceutical scam and tracks it back to a locally owned pharmacy
- Its a mom and pop shop but their daughter works there too and they have an idea...Baxter can get to her
- Doogan plays Cyrano for Baxter to help get information from the pharmacy employee
- The pharmacy tech is actually the grand daughter of the couple who own and run the pharmacy but they've reached an age where they just aren't paying attention enough to notice the scam happening right under their noses and their grand daughter is sweet and well meaning but not too bright, making it easy for the scam insurance company to influence her
- But she does give them the name of the person at Theta Health that she works with, which is a big lead
- Turns out the pharmacy was a dead end but they do find out that all prescriptions to fake patients are covered under the same health insurance...Theta Health	

Episode 6
- The team follows up on some leads from Nancy and the Pharmacy and end up finding Theta Health
- Attempts to get into the building are unsuccessful
- They decide to lean on the doctor more, who gives them more details
- Martinez is starting to put some pieces together on his own and Doogan gets nervous but Doogan has figured out that cops took a blood test after he was drugged the second time and starts asking about that

Episode 7
- The team infiltrates the insurance company as a potential investor but they might recognize Doogan or Eddie so they need a huge favor from Abby
- Abby chats up one of the other investors in the waiting room and it seems very suspicious
- Baxter uses the employee names from Theta Health offices that Abby snapped photos of to dig up more information but it just leads to more fake information
- Abby meets the CEO and says he looks oddly familiar so she snaps a picture of him...its Sebastian
- The Investor she meets in the lobby is a real person and their first piece of concrete information
- Martinez is pressing on Doogan (with a different partner this time) and he ends up telling him that the Doctor has totally disappeared, which makes sense if he's in on the insurance scam
- Abby snags sneaks a peek at a few files and snaps pictures of the investor names from the files
- The team figures out that Baxter has to go back undercover

Episode 8
- Baxter has to return to the pharmacist's daughter to compare the investors Abby found with the pharmacy patients to find a trend in the data and now they have what they believe is the investor list
- Now they need a way to get some of them to break and give them the details they need to break the case wide open
- Martinez and the first partner show up to talk Doogan and he describes what's really happening but Martinez tells him that he doesn't investigate white collar crimes for a reason.  They take years and rarely stick.  Unless Doogan has a real witness to testify, there's no way they get the traction for a bigger investigation
- Since the Doctor from the clinic has disappeared and the pharmacy tech is not really aware of the crime, the team starts trying to figure out which investor might turn over evidence

Episode 9
- The rush is on to find an investor who will crack and uncover the identities of the scammers and the team all has to help out
- But getting them arrested for insurance fraud isn't enough, they need to go away for murder
- They uncover a larger client list of investors, still waiting to be paid and then they find the medical bills
- The scammers are not just running a fake insurance company but a fake medical billing company too and they're scamming both the underwriting insurer but the investors too, by sending them fake medical bills to for the patients on the insured patients
- They inform one of the investors about the fake medical billing company and the scammers double dipping and conning them too and they break and agree to testify
- Baxter finally gets a lead on the real identities of the scammers and he finds the clinic doctor's plans for leaving the country
- Doogan is arrested but not for murder as Martinez has decided that he's guilty of prostitution

Episode 10
- Doogan sits in the same cold jail cell as he has twice now
- The team exposes the scammers but also exposes the scam and the terminal patients and beneficiaries
- Martinez has one of his homicide detective team waiting for the doctor at the airport
- As the scam ring leader is being arrested he claims that he will go to a country club prison which is when the team points out that the drugs in Doogan's system were from a prescription he got from the pharmacy so he's not going away for an insurance scam but for murder, which won't feel like a country club
- The doctor and the investor have agreed to testify against the scammers, who arranged for the murders and framing Doogan
- The DA decides not to press charges on Doogan for the rebound business as she's the prologue rebound
