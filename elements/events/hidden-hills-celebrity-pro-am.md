# The Hidden Hills Celebrity Pro-Am

**Tournament Type:** Week-Long Celebrity Pro-Am Charity Event with Professional Exhibition  
**Location:** Hidden Hills Golf Club, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA  
**Dates:** Sunday Evening - Saturday  
**Prize Purse:** $300,000 (professional exhibition round only)  
**Field:** 40 LPGA professionals + 40 celebrities  
**Beneficiary:** Women in STEM Scholarship Fund  
**Format:** Week-long charity event featuring meet-and-greet, skills competitions, celebrity activities, two Pro-Am rounds, and single professional exhibition round finale

**Tournament Background:**
This is a celebrity charity Pro-Am that "colors outside the lines" of standard LPGA events. Week-long format allows relationship building, multiple fundraising opportunities, and extensive media coverage for the cause. The smaller field (40 pros vs typical 120+) and single professional round keeps it intimate while still showcasing talent. Similar to celebrity charity events but with more golf substance than typical one-day scrambles.

**Scoring:** Team's better score per hole counts  
**Time:** 1:00 PM shotgun start

**How Best Ball Works:**
- Both players play their own ball throughout
- On each hole, the better score of the two counts
- Allows weaker player (celebrity) to take risks without hurting team
- Pro can "save" the hole if celebrity struggles
- All teams play, no cuts

**Course Details:**

- Galleries allowed
- Media coverage

**Story Beats:**

- Doogan helping Mara stay patient
- Candy/Tilly's team does well (Candy's drives carry them)

---

### **Thursday - Pro-Am Round 2**
**Format:** Modified Scramble  
**Scoring:** Combined team score  
**Time:** Morning tee times

**How Modified Scramble Works:**
- Both players tee off
- Team chooses best shot, both play from there
- Celebrity's shot MUST be used on at least 4 holes (keeps it fair/interesting)
- Prevents pros from dominating completely

**Story Beats:**
- **Doogan caddies for Mara**
- Team chemistry peaks - Mara and Brenda having fun
- Mara shows emotion, laughs at Brenda's assistant's dramatics
- They finish strong, good team placement
- Emotional payoff - Mara thanks Brenda for making it fun
- First time all week Mara looks relaxed
- Media notices personality shift

### **Friday - Professional Exhibition Round**
**Format:** Single-round stroke play  
**Field:** All 40 pros compete (no cut - smaller field)  
**Time:** Morning tee times

**How It Works:**
- Standard stroke play
- All 40 professionals play
- Leaders (Mara and Candy) paired together in final group
- Prize money: $300,000 purse

**Course Conditions:**
- High pressure weather system moves in
- Wind picks up significantly

**Story Beats:**
- **Doogan caddies for Mara**
- Mara playing loose, confident golf all day
- Coming down to 18th hole, Mara and Candy tied
- Par 5, 520 yards, dogleg right with trees on right side
- Candy from Arizona misjudges distance (used to thin air/elevation)
- Goes for green in two, ball clips trees, ends up in rough
- Doogan advises Mara to lay up (smart, conservative play)
- Mara trusts him completely, lays up
- Makes par easily, Candy makes bogey
- **Mara wins by one stroke**
- Post-round interview: Mara smiling, joking, showing personality
- Credits Doogan's advice on 18
- Jake's phone starts ringing (sponsors saw the personality)

- **Monday:** Skills day - Doogan impresses Mara with golf knowledge, Brenda provides comedy
- **Tuesday:** Celebrity activities (Eddie/Abby can investigate)
- **Wednesday:** Pro-Am Round 1, Mara tense but Doogan helping
- **Thursday:** Pro-Am Round 2, team clicking, emotional payoff with Brenda
- **Friday:** Awards ceremony, no golf (Eddie/Abby nail salon discovery)
- **Saturday:** Professional exhibition, showdown with Candy, victory

**Doogan's Arc:**
- Sunday: Jake introduces him as "auction winner" caddy
- Monday: Shows unexpected golf knowledge at skills competitions, earns Mara's respect
- Wednesday-Thursday: Becoming essential to her game in Pro-Am rounds
- Saturday: She trusts him completely (weather call proves his value)

**Mara's Arc:**
- Sunday: Wound tight, isolated, skeptical of "auction winner" caddy
- Monday: Surprised by Doogan's competence, small cracks in armor
- Wednesday: Learning to trust him on course
- Thursday: Showing emotion, connecting with Brenda's assistant comedy, having fun
- Saturday: Playing free, trusting instinct, winning with personality showing

**Investigation B-Plot:**
**Investigation B-Plot:**
- Happens parallel throughout week
- Eddie/Abby visiting patients while Doogan at tournament events
- Tuesday (celebrity day) and Friday (awards day) give Eddie/Abby full investigation days
- Saturday after tournament ends: Abby visits clinic, spots Nancy's nails
- Saturday evening: Nail salon discovery, gets dirt on Nancy
- Setup for Episode 4 with Doogan as investigator

**Plausibility Notes:**
- Week-long Celebrity Pro-Am format allows flexibility for charity event
- Can "color outside the lines" because it's not a sanctioned LPGA tour event
- Smaller field (40 pros) so no cut needed for Saturday
- Skills competitions and celebrity activities are standard for charity golf events
- "Auction winner caddy" cover story fits charity fundraising theme
- Single exhibition round keeps focus tight while allowing week-long relationship building
