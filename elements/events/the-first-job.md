# The First Job

## Relative Time
**12 years before story start** — A couple of months before college graduation

---

## Summary
The fraternity's vice president, a trust fund kid, faces a relationship crisis: he's been hooking up with a girl from their sister sorority all semester, but he's secretly engaged to a wealthy family friend's daughter who promises him a lucrative job after graduation. He needs to end things cleanly without risking his engagement or career prospects. Eddie spots the opportunity and pitches Doogan as the solution — for a price, Doogan will charm the girl, make her grateful for the breakup, and ensure she wishes the VP well in his marriage. The plan works flawlessly, and Eddie and Doogan discover they have a talent for solving problems that money and morals can't fix.

## Characters Involved
- **Eddie**: The hustler who sees the business opportunity. Pitches the scheme to the VP and convinces Doogan to take the job. This is his first taste of monetizing Doogan's legendary charm.
- **Doogan**: Already legendary with women across campus. Reluctantly agrees to help for the money (both he and Eddie are broke compared to the trust fund kids). Successfully charms the girl and executes the clean breakup.
- **The Vice President (VP)**: Trust fund kid with everything to lose. Desperate enough to pay Eddie and Doogan to solve his problem. Represents the entitled clients they'll serve for years to come.
- **The Girl**: Sister sorority member who's been dating the VP all semester. Unaware of his secret engagement. Becomes the first successful "rebound" when Doogan sweeps in, making her forget the VP entirely.

---

## Setting
- **College campus** — Fraternity house, parties, sister sorority events
- **Atmosphere**: Mix of youthful hustle and desperation. Eddie and Doogan are scraping by financially while surrounded by wealth. The contrast between their resourcefulness and the VP's privileged incompetence sets the tone for their future business model.
- **Tone**: Comic and clever, with an undercurrent of class tension — two broke kids outsmarting the rich guy's problem.

---

## Conflict / Stakes
- **For the VP**: A messy breakup could expose his secret engagement, costing him both his fiancée and the promised job. He's panicking and willing to pay.
- **For Eddie and Doogan**: They need money desperately and this is their chance to capitalize on Doogan's reputation. But it's also morally questionable — they're helping a rich kid lie his way into a marriage while manipulating an innocent girl's feelings.
- **The Risk**: If the plan fails, the VP could turn on them. If it succeeds, they might realize they're good at something deeply unethical — and profitable.

---

## Humor & Style Notes
- **Eddie's pitch**: Delivered with shameless confidence, turning the VP's crisis into a "business opportunity." He probably uses buzzwords like "relationship consultant" or "transition specialist" before they land on "rebound specialist."
- **Doogan's reluctance**: He's legendary with women, but he's never been *paid* to use that talent. His agreement comes with wisecracks about Eddie's morals (or lack thereof).
- **The execution**: Doogan charms the girl effortlessly — she's so smitten she tells the VP she's "grateful they can both move on" and wishes him happiness. The VP is stunned it worked.
- **The aftermath**: Eddie immediately starts pitching Doogan on making this a regular thing. Doogan says no. Cut to: them doing it again after graduation.
- **Ironic beat**: The girl probably ends up happier without the VP anyway, which lets Eddie and Doogan rationalize that they're actually *helping* people.

## Continuity Links

### Sets Up:
- **The business model**: This is the origin of "The Rebound Specialist" — Eddie finds clients, Doogan plays the rebound.
- **Eddie and Doogan's dynamic**: Eddie as the shameless hustler, Doogan as the talented but reluctant operator. This pattern will repeat throughout their careers.
- **Their financial motivation**: Neither has money, so they're willing to bend ethics for cash. This desperation becomes their business philosophy.
- **Doogan's reputation**: His legendary status with women is established and becomes his professional asset.
- **The trust fund clientele**: The VP represents their typical client — wealthy, entitled, willing to pay others to solve their messy problems.

### Connects To:
- **Post-graduation**: After this success, they turn it into a full business. Eddie handles client acquisition, Doogan handles execution.
- **Abby's introduction**: She's likely around during college (as a mutual friend) and watches this scheme unfold, which is why she's perpetually unimpressed with their business.
- **Rodney's hiring**: As the business grows, they realize they need tech support for background checks, fake profiles, etc. — leading to Rodney joining the team.
- **Current story**: 12 years later, this "routine" model collapses when Doogan wakes up next to a dead woman, proving their morally questionable business was bound to catch up with them eventually.

## Additional Notes
This event establishes the **comedic-cynical foundation** of the series:
- They're not heroes — they're opportunists who stumbled into a profitable gray area.
- Their success is built on charm, hustle, and a willingness to ignore ethics for money.
- The friendship between Eddie and Doogan is genuine, but their business is morally bankrupt.
- They rationalize their work as "helping people" when really they're just helping rich people avoid consequences.

This origin story makes their eventual entanglement in a murder conspiracy feel like karmic justice wrapped in absurdist comedy.
