**Style:**
- On course: Simple, professional golf attire. Prefers muted colors - navy, gray, white, burgundy. Nothing flashy or attention-seeking. Practical visors, not trendy hats.

- Jewelry: Minimal. Small gold stud earrings (gift from her parents). Simple watch for timing rounds.
- Footwear: Professional golf shoes on course, flip-flops off course (Islander habit)

**Vehicle:** Practical SUV (needs space for golf equipment and Alex's car seat when he's with her). Nothing flashy - probably a Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4.

## Personal Life

### Son - Alex
- **Age:** 3 years old
- **Living Situation:** Lives with Mara's parents on Maui during tournaments
- **Father:** Not in the picture much. Subject is vague and Mara doesn't discuss it. Happened while she was on tour. Some child support comes in, but he's essentially absent.
- **Mara's Guilt:** Constant struggle between career and motherhood. Misses him intensely during tournaments but knows she needs to work.

### Family
- **Parents:** Both still on Maui. Father still works at Kapalua (now head groundskeeper after 30+ years). Mother was a teacher, now retired. They provide childcare during Mara's tournament schedule.
- **Extended Family:** Large extended Hawaiian family on Maui. Cousins, aunts, uncles - the support system that makes single motherhood possible.

### Financial Situation
- Bills are paid, receives some child support
- Living in Hawaii is expensive - even with family help
- Needs endorsement money to make life easier for herself and Alex
- Prize money from LPGA is good when she places well, but not consistent enough
- Jake knows she has the talent and story for major endorsements if she'd just be more personable with press

### Regular Caddy
- **Jenny Traverse:** Her regular caddy. Professional, knows Mara's game inside and out.
- For this Pro-Am, Jake asked Jenny to take a convenient trip home to visit family so Doogan could caddy and get close to Mara.
- Mara doesn't question this much - it's just a Pro-Am, not part of tour points, so having a substitute caddy isn't unusual.

## Personality

### Core Traits
- **Intensely Focused:** Sometimes to her own detriment. Gets tunnel vision on performance.
- **Intelligent:** Understands course strategy, weather patterns, equipment technology. Analytical mind.
- **Competitive:** Hates losing, but plays fair. Respects the integrity of the game too much to cheat or showboat.
- **Serious:** Since her comeback, has been all business. Press sees her as cold or distant.
- **Protective:** Of women's golf as a legitimate sport. Candy's social media approach offends her professional sensibilities.

### Hidden Qualities (Doogan Will Unlock)
- **Dry Humor:** Has an observational, understated sense of humor that's been buried under stress
- **Warm:** With people she trusts, she's warm and generous
- **Playful:** Was known for pranks and jokes early in her career - that side has disappeared
- **Self-Aware:** Knows she's been too serious, but doesn't know how to turn it off

### With Press/Public
- Gives short, technical answers
- Doesn't smile much in interviews
- Comes across as cold or uninterested
- Makes sponsors nervous - not "marketable"

### What She Needs
- Permission to be human
- Someone who makes her laugh
- Reminder that she can be both a great golfer AND a real person
- To show vulnerability without it being a weakness

## Relationships

### With Jake Townsend (Manager)
- He believes in her completely
- She trusts him but is frustrated that he keeps pushing her to "open up"
- Doesn't know he hired Doogan - thinks Doogan is genuinely interested
- Their relationship is professional but warm - he's been her manager since she turned pro

### With Jenny Traverse (Caddy)
- Professional partnership built on trust
- Jenny knows Mara's moods and game better than anyone
- When Jenny isn't there, Mara feels slightly off-balance (sets up Doogan's role)

### With Other LPGA Players
- Respected by veteran players
- Seen as too serious by younger players
- Friendly but not part of the social scene
- Candy Hoover drives her crazy

### With Doogan
- Initially suspicious (she's been burned by guys who want to date "the lady golfer")
- Gradually disarms as he proves he's not threatened by her success
- His humor catches her off-guard
- He makes her feel seen as a person, not just an athlete
- The fact that he's a solid golfer himself (not a pro, but respectable) earns her respect

## Character Arc in Episode 3

**Beginning:** Wound tight, separated from Alex, feeling the pressure, shanking balls, worried about proving herself

**Middle:** Doogan helps her relax, shows her it's okay to be human, makes her laugh, reminds her why she loved golf in the first place

**End:** Wins the tournament by trusting Doogan's advice (the high-pressure weather call), shows genuine emotion, gives a better interview, Jake has hope for her marketability

**The Rebound Success:** Mara doesn't fall in love with Doogan, but he reminds her that she can be both serious AND likeable. She remembers how to smile. The press notices. Sponsors start calling.

## Signature Mannerisms

- Checks her phone for messages from Alex between holes
- Adjusts her ponytail when nervous
- Has a pre-shot routine that's almost meditative (three deep breaths, one practice swing)
- Says "Mahalo" (thank you in Hawaiian) without thinking about it
- Squints when analyzing shots (should probably wear sunglasses more)
- Paces when thinking through strategy

## Key Quote

"Sure, but Phil Mickelson never had a C-section."  
*(When someone asks if she's back to tournament fitness)*

---

## Notes for Writing Scenes

- She should NOT cry or break down - that's not who she is
- Her softening should be subtle - a laugh here, a joke there
- Keep her competent and capable - Doogan helps her relax, not save her
- Her love for Alex should be evident but not maudlin
- Golf technical details should be accurate - she thinks in terms of club selection, wind speed, green break
- Hawaiian details should be authentic but not stereotypical
- When she finally loosens up, it should feel earned, not sudden

---

**CONTINUITY CRITICAL:**
- Son's name: ALEX (age 3)
- Lives on MAUI with parents
- Father at KAPALUA (groundskeeper)
- 3 major championships BEFORE hiatus
- ZERO majors since comeback (but playing best golf of her life)
- C-section recovery was part of comeback challenge
- Regular caddy: JENNY TRAVERSE (away visiting family during Pro-Am)
