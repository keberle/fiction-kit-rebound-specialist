## Name
**Terry Tamborino**

## Role in the Story
**Wedding Planner / Unwitting Ally**
Terry is the Billings family wedding planner who has been orchestrating Gabby's "social wedding of the season" for months. He's a perfectionist who treats every wedding like opening night on Broadway. He doesn't know about Doogan's rebound specialist work—thinks Doogan is just a family friend setup for Cheryl. Frankly, he doesn't care about the details as long as it keeps Cheryl from "going full Cheryl" and ruining his meticulously planned weekend.

## Personality Traits
1. **Theatrical Perfectionist** – Operates at 150% intensity at all times; treats wedding crises with the gravity of international incidents
2. **Rapid-Fire Multitasker** – Talks to three people simultaneously while holding tablet and phone; never loses track of any conversation
3. **Organized to Obsession** – Color-coded schedules, backup plans for backup plans, sends detailed maps nobody reads
4. **Sardonically Exasperated** – Quick with cutting observations but never cruel, just perpetually annoyed at chaos he didn't orchestrate
5. **Genuinely Protective** – Despite the dramatics, he truly wants Gabby's day to be perfect and takes pride in his work

## Background
Terry has been planning weddings for twenty years and has built a reputation for pulling off flawless events for Southern California's wealthy elite. He's seen every kind of family drama, dealt with every bridezilla and demanding mother-of-the-bride, and survived it all through a combination of adrenaline, espresso, and pure willpower.

The Billings wedding is particularly important—it's a showcase event that will either cement his reputation or become a cautionary tale. Sylvia Billings has been both his dream client (unlimited budget, excellent taste) and his nightmare (micromanages everything, invited too many people, insisted on that literature-themed scavenger hunt).

## Voice & Style
Sharp, rapid-fire delivery with theatrical flair. Terry speaks fast—Nathan Lane fast—with dramatic pauses for effect and constant hand gestures. He uses sardonic commentary and genuine emotion in the same breath, cycles through exasperation and determination without missing a beat.

When stressed (which is often), he talks even faster and gestures more dramatically. Has a running internal monologue he occasionally says out loud. Makes theatrical pronouncements that would sound absurd from anyone else but are somehow perfectly in character.

**Sample Quotes:**

- "—no no no, that's the *groomsmen* staging area, you're bridesmaids, bridesmaids gather on the east lawn, I literally sent a map, did anyone read the map? Of course you didn't, nobody reads maps anymore, everybody just follows little blue dots on their phones and then acts surprised when they end up at the service entrance—"

- "If Jillian wins I will personally lose my mind. Do you understand? I will have a complete psychological break, right here, on the club patio, and someone will have to call my therapist."

- "You know what I love about weddings? The romance. The joy. The celebration of love. You know what I hate? Everything else. The logistics. The family drama. The bridesmaids who treat my carefully planned events like content opportunities for their Instagram followers."

- "Terry does not have time for this. Terry has seventeen moving parts, four vendor crises, and a mother-of-the-bride who just decided—thirty minutes ago—that we need more peonies. Where am I supposed to get peonies? Do I look like someone who has a secret peony connection?"

## Relationships

**Doogan Andrews** – Appreciates him immediately for showing up on time and following instructions. Secretly thinks Doogan is too good-looking to be straight but is too busy managing the wedding to investigate further. Views him as a useful tool for keeping Cheryl contained and functional.

**Cheryl Billings** – Equal parts exasperated and sympathetic. Knows she's dealing with complicated feelings about her sister's wedding but needs her to hold it together for the weekend. Relieved Doogan is handling her so Terry doesn't have to.

**Gabby Billings** – Protective of her in a genuine way. This is her day, and Terry is determined to make it perfect despite all the chaos. She's been sweet and reasonable throughout the planning, which makes him want to deliver even more.

**Sylvia Billings** – Complicated relationship. She's given him unlimited budget and creative freedom, but she also micromanages, changes her mind, and insists on things like literature-themed scavenger hunts. He respects her taste even when it makes his job harder.

**Jillian** – Views her as a social media menace who treats his carefully planned events as content opportunities. She's everything he hates about modern weddings—performative, shallow, treating real moments like they're auditions for sponsorships.

## Motivations
- **Surface Level:** Pull off a flawless wedding, maintain his reputation, get through the weekend without a nervous breakdown
- **Deeper Level:** Prove he's the best wedding planner in Southern California; show that weddings can still be meaningful despite the chaos
- **Deepest Level:** Create perfect moments for couples because he believes in romance even if he's too exhausted to experience it himself
- **The Fear:** That something will go catastrophically wrong and destroy his reputation; that he'll lose control of the event he's planned for months

## Humor & Style Notes
Terry is hilarious in the Nathan Lane theatrical neurotic way. His comedy comes from:

- **The Multitasking Spiral** – Talking to three people at once while managing tablet and phone, never losing track of any thread
- **Theatrical Pronouncements** – Everything is high drama, every problem is the end of the world, every solution is a triumph
- **The Exasperated Professional** – He's seen it all, done it all, and is perpetually shocked that people keep doing the same ridiculous things
- **Physical Comedy** – Expressive face, dramatic gestures, body language that does half the storytelling
- **The Third Person** – When stressed, starts referring to himself as "Terry" instead of "I"

**Running Gags:**
- Nobody reads his detailed maps/instructions
- Always managing multiple crises simultaneously
- Makes dire predictions about what will happen if things go wrong (they're usually accurate)
- His pocket squares are always coordinated to something (table linens, Sylvia's dress, the bridesmaid bouquets)
- Theatrical hand gestures that nearly knock things over
- His internal monologue escaping as actual dialogue

## Notes for Writers

**Nathan Lane Reference:**
Terry's energy, timing, and delivery are based on Nathan Lane's comedic style—particularly his work in *The Birdcage* and *The Producers*. Quick wit, theatrical delivery, physical comedy through gesture and expression, ability to be both cutting and warm in the same moment.

**Voice Pattern:**
- Talks fast, especially when stressed
- Often mid-sentence when scenes begin
- Uses "—" dashes for interrupted thoughts
- Makes pronouncements that sound absurd but are delivered with complete sincerity
- Cycles between sarcasm and genuine emotion rapidly

**Comedy Balance:**
Terry is a comedic character, but not a joke. He's excellent at his job, genuinely cares about his work, and is the glue holding the wedding weekend together. The humor comes from his theatrical personality and exasperation with chaos, not from incompetence.
