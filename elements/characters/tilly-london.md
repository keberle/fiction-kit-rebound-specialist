**What Makes Her Worse Than Candy:**

## Character Function in Episode 3

**Purpose:**
- **Maximum Annoyance:** The ceiling of insufferable
- **Target for Mara and Doogan:** Safe target for their bonding - they can both roll eyes at Tilly
- **Amplifies Candy:** Together they're insufferable squared
- **Comic Relief:** But irritating comic relief - more cringe than funny
- **Contrast:** Makes even Candy look better by comparison

**Dynamic with Candy:**
- They're "besties" (for content)
- Feed off each other's energy
- Constantly filming each other
- Everything is "content" and "vibes"
- Together they create a bubble of influencer culture that repels normal people

**Dynamic with Mara:**
- Tilly doesn't really register Mara as important (not famous enough)
- Asks Mara to take photos of her and Candy
- Doesn't understand golf rules or etiquette
- Mara finds her insufferable
- Tilly is completely oblivious to Mara's disdain

**Dynamic with Brenda:**
- Brenda finds her fascinating in a "nature documentary" way
- Makes mental notes for future comedy material
- Tilly doesn't register Brenda's gentle mockery
- Brenda might have a hilarious talking head moment about Tilly later

**Dynamic with Doogan:**
- He'd be polite but amused
- Might make subtle jokes to Mara about her
- Tilly would probably try to flirt (she flirts with everyone attractive)
- He'd deflect smoothly

## On the Golf Course

**Her "Performance":**
- Brings film crew (for reality show)
- Constantly stopping to film "content"
- Poses with golf clubs she doesn't know how to use
- Asks Candy to teach her (Candy is patient because followers)
- Probably quits after 9 holes claiming sun damage or exhaustion
- If she does finish, it's because crew is making her

**Golf Skills:**
- Can maybe hit the ball one out of five times
- Doesn't understand par, bogey, birdie
- Asks inappropriate questions during other players' shots
- More interested in how she looks holding a club than using it
- Squeals loudly at everything

---

## Reality Show Angle

**"London Calling" Cameras:**
- Follow her throughout Pro-Am
- Create drama where none exists
- Edit everything to make her look glamorous and fun
- Other participants have to sign releases
- Mara HATES this but Jake made her sign off (exposure)
- Creates additional chaos and irritation

**Manufactured Drama:**
- "Conflict" with another reality star (pre-planned)
- "Romance" tease with someone (fake)
- "Journey" of learning golf (abandoned after one episode)
- Everything is scripted chaos

---

## Personal Life (What Little We Know)

- **Relationships:** Series of public relationships with other influencers/reality stars for publicity
- **Family:** Probably normal people who are embarrassed but enjoy the money
- **Home:** Rents luxury apartment in West Hollywood for show, probably actually lives somewhere less fancy
- **Education:** "Some college" (maybe one semester)
- **Income:** Sponsored content, appearance fees, reality show salary - makes surprising amount of money

---

## What Makes Her Annoying

1. **Self-Absorption:** Everything is about her
2. **Fake Enthusiasm:** Nothing is genuine
3. **Disrespectful:** Doesn't respect the game, event, or other participants
4. **Loud:** Volume set to 11 at all times
5. **Oblivious:** Doesn't notice (or care) when she's bothering people
6. **Entitled:** Expects special treatment
7. **Performative:** Every moment is content
8. **Ignorant:** Proud of not knowing things
9. **Treats People as Props:** Caddies, staff, other players are background for her show

---

## Signature Mannerisms

- Hair flip (constantly)
- Pouts for photos
- Makes duck face
- Says "Oh my god" at ear-splitting volume
- Checks phone every 30 seconds
- Poses unconsciously
- Touches people when talking (invasion of personal space)
- Squeals instead of laughs
- Name drops constantly
- Corrects people on her "brand"

---

## Key Dialogue Patterns

- Valley girl speak taken to extreme
- "Like" every other word
- Vocal fry
- Questions that end with upward inflection
- "Literally" used incorrectly constantly
- "Obsessed" with everything
- "Iconic" for mundane things
- Social media language out loud ("That's so on brand!")
- Refers to herself in third person ("Tilly doesn't do mornings")

---

## Contrast with Brenda

**Brenda:** Self-deprecating, genuinely funny, respects the game, humble, smart  
**Tilly:** Self-aggrandizing, accidentally funny (cringe), disrespects everything, entitled, vapid

This contrast shows there's a right way and wrong way to be a non-golfer at a Pro-Am.

---

## Notes for Writing

- Use sparingly - she's irritating, not a main character
- Best in small doses for maximum annoyance
- She and Candy together should be almost unbearable
- Perfect target for Mara and Doogan's bonding through shared eye-rolls
- Don't make her evil - just insufferable
- Her obliviousness should be both frustrating and comedic
- Show how she disrupts everything without meaning to

---

## Scene Uses

**Good for:**
- Comic relief through cringe
- Bonding material for Mara and Doogan
- Showing what Mara could never become
- Tournament chaos and disruption
- Background noise that makes Mara's quiet moments with Doogan more valuable

**Bad for:**
- Extended dialogue scenes
- Character development (she has none)
- Any moment requiring subtlety

---

**CONTINUITY CRITICAL:**
- Age 25, reality TV star
- Show: "LONDON CALLING"
- Paired with CANDY HOOVER for Pro-Am
- 5.6M Instagram, 3.8M TikTok followers
- Essentially ZERO golf skills
- Has reality show cameras following her
- More annoying than Candy
- Used primarily as target for Mara/Doogan bonding
- Probably quits early or phones it in
- Everything is "content" for her
