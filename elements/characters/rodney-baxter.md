![Rodney "Baxter" Baxter — youthful, thin, hoodie-and-sneakers tech-kid energy; alert eyes, avoids eye contact.](rodney-baxter.jpg)

## Name
**Full Name:** Rodney Baxter  
**Goes By:** "Baxter" (among friends and the team)  
**"Rodney":** Only used by his mother  

---

## Role in the Story
**Tech Wizard & Intelligence Support**  
Baxter is the team's technological backbone—handling internet research, background checks, surveillance systems, hacking, and real-time intelligence. He provides Doogan with critical intel through a nearly undetectable CIA-level earpiece, making him indispensable to every operation. Without him, the team would be flying blind.

He was recommended by a college professor friend of Abby's, and despite initial skepticism, they quickly realized they couldn't function without him.

## Personality Traits
- **Genius-level intelligence** – Prodigy-level tech skills, can hack almost anything
- **Socially awkward** – Struggles with basic social interactions, especially with women
- **Innocent & earnest** – Lacks cynicism; sees the world through a more naive lens
- **Eager to please** – Desperate to prove his worth and be accepted by the team
- **Fascinated by Doogan** – Watches Doogan's interactions with women like a documentary on a foreign culture
- **Resilient** – Despite constant teasing from Eddie, he keeps showing up and trying

**Strengths:** Technology, research, problem-solving, loyalty  
**Weaknesses:** Social skills, confidence, dating, reading social cues

## Background
Rodney finished high school at 15 and immediately enrolled in college, but the social pressures and isolation overwhelmed him. He dropped out at 17, retreating to his mother's basement where he now lives and operates his command center.

A college professor friend of Abby Palmer recognized his potential and suggested he work with the team. What started as a trial quickly became permanent when they realized how desperately they needed someone with his skills.

He's never had a real job outside of working with Abby, Eddie, and Doogan. His entire professional experience is helping con artists and private investigators—which he finds infinitely more interesting than any corporate IT job.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Youthful appearance** – Looks younger than his actual age, reminiscent of Doogie Howser MD
- **Height:** Shorter than average (around 5'6")
- **Build:** Thin, not athletic, spends most of his time sitting in front of screens
- **Hair:** Neatly kept but nothing stylish—functional haircut
- **Eyes:** Alert, intense when focused on screens, but avoids eye contact in conversation
- **Clothing style:** Hoodies, graphic t-shirts (often tech or gaming related), jeans, sneakers—comfort over fashion
- **Posture:** Slightly hunched from hours at the computer
- **Distinctive features:** Baby face, often looks confused or overwhelmed in social situations

**Recurring gag:** Always has some new piece of tech gear on him—smart glasses, fitness tracker, prototype earbuds—like a walking Best Buy.

## Voice & Style
Baxter speaks quickly when excited about technology, but stammers and trails off in social situations. He uses tech jargon naturally, often forgetting others don't speak his language. His references are almost entirely from gaming, sci-fi, and internet culture.

**Sample Quotes:**
- "I've got eyes on the target—literally. I hacked the restaurant's security cameras. Also, their Yelp rating is misleading; the duck is apparently dry."
- "So you just... smiled at her? And she gave you her number? That's it? No algorithm? No compatibility matrix?"
- "Eddie, I know you're joking, but statistically speaking, a basement command center is actually the optimal workspace for—never mind."
- "My mom says I should get out more, but she doesn't understand the latency issues with mobile hotspots."

## Relationships

**Abby Palmer:** Grateful for the opportunity she gave him. Respects her intelligence and appreciates that she treats him with patience (most of the time).

**Doogan Andrews:** Complete fascination. Studies Doogan like an anthropologist studying a rare species. Constantly asks questions about how he talks to women, what he says, how he knows what to do. Doogan finds it endearing but sometimes exhausting.

**Eddie Palmer:** Eddie is his mentor but also his primary tormentor. Eddie teases him relentlessly in that Vince Vaughn way—charming, constant, but never quite cruel. Baxter both admires Eddie's confidence and dreads his commentary. Eddie gives him dating advice that ranges from surprisingly helpful to completely absurd.

---

## Motivations
- **Prove his worth** – Wants to show he belongs on the team despite his social deficits
- **Learn from Doogan** – Genuinely wants to understand how normal (attractive) people navigate social situations
- **Technology mastery** – Driven to create the perfect surveillance and intelligence system
- **Someday get a date** – Deep down, he hopes that working with these people will somehow help him figure out how to talk to women
- **Independence (eventually)** – Part of him wants to move out of his mom's basement, but the setup is really good down there

---

## Humor & Style Notes
- **Running gag:** Baxter's complete bafflement at Doogan's success with women. He takes notes.
- **Eddie's teasing:** Constantly suggests increasingly absurd ways for Baxter to meet women ("Have you tried the grocery store? Women love groceries.")
- **His mom:** Occasionally calls or texts during operations, usually about dinner or laundry
- **Over-prepared:** Shows up to briefings with elaborate PowerPoint presentations that no one asked for
- **The earpiece:** Baxter is extremely proud of the military-grade covert communications device he acquired for Doogan through questionably legal sources. It's comparable to equipment used by CIA operatives and Secret Service agents—nearly invisible, flesh-toned, uses bone conduction technology for audio. Baxter sourced it through gray-market intelligence equipment dealers he found on encrypted forums. He brings it up frequently as evidence of his resourcefulness and technical expertise. Doogan wears it almost constantly (except during intimate moments, sleeping, or showering), allowing Baxter to maintain near-constant communication during operations. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 2)*
- **Social media craftsman:** Baxter creates and maintains carefully crafted social media profiles for Doogan (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) that make him appear genuine and attractive. The profiles include curated photos, believable posts, and strategic details designed to pass background checks by potential targets. Annabelle Anders stalked Doogan's Instagram before their second meeting and liked what she saw—proof of Baxter's skill at digital identity construction. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 8)*
- **Real-time intel delivery:** During operations, Baxter provides instant research through the earpiece—restaurant reviews, social media details, background information—allowing Doogan to appear psychic. His ability to find information in seconds is crucial to Doogan's "magic tricks." *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 8)*
- **Physical comedy potential:** His awkwardness in any situation requiring him to leave the van/command center

## Continuity Links
- **The First Job:** Likely where he's introduced, proving his value by pulling off something technologically impressive
- **Recurring element:** Baxter in the van/command center, providing intel through the earpiece while making commentary
- **Character arc potential:** Gradual improvement in social skills; maybe eventually goes on an actual date (disaster comedy ensues)
- **Relationship with team:** Evolution from outsider to indispensable member to genuine friend
- **Tech upgrades:** Each episode/chapter could feature a new piece of tech he's developed or acquired

---

**Key Comedy Dynamic:** The contrast between his digital omniscience (he can hack anything, find anyone, see everything) and his complete inability to navigate a basic conversation with an attractive woman. He can break into a government database but can't make eye contact at Starbucks.
