## Role in the Story
**Antagonist / Master of the Long Con**
John Wipple is the architect of a sprawling, multi-layered fraud operation. He specializes in the long con, building entire companies as fronts for financial crime. His genius lies in his ability to fully inhabit each persona—Sebastian LeClere, the urbane Belgian executive; Albert Stans, the brash Boston insurance disruptor; and, beneath it all, John Wipple, a self-taught manipulator from Alabama.
He moves seamlessly between identities, maintaining separate networks, histories, and even mannerisms. Each persona is supported by forged documents, social media profiles, and a web of shell corporations. His true talent is psychological manipulation: he reads people instantly, adapts his approach, and exploits their ambitions and fears.
The story follows his elaborate schemes, the mounting suspicions of those around him, and the gradual unraveling of his web of lies—culminating in his arrest and the revelation of his real identity.

## Personality Traits
1. **Chameleon-like** – Effortlessly shifts speech, dress, and demeanor to fit each identity; can become anyone in any room
2. **Calculating and Patient** – Plans years ahead, never rushes a con; every move is deliberate

## Background
John Wipple grew up in Mobile, Alabama, the son of a failed entrepreneur. Dropped out of college after a scandal involving falsified grades and a stolen exam. Discovered a knack for impersonation and deception early—first as a petty grifter, then as a builder of elaborate corporate fronts.
His first major con involved posing as a French investor to swindle a tech startup. From there, he refined his craft, learning languages, accents, and the nuances of international business.
As Sebastian LeClere, he crafted a Belgian immigrant’s story—complete with a forged university degree, a believable accent, and a network of European contacts. As Albert Stans, he became the quintessential Boston insurance executive, leveraging industry jargon and local connections.
He keeps his real past buried, erasing digital traces and manipulating public records. Only a handful of clues—an old yearbook photo, a Southern accent that slips out under stress—hint at his origins.
