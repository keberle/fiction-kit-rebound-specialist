## Physical Description

**Height:** 5'5"  
**Build:** Athletic but curvy. Toned from golf but maintains feminine curves. Knows her angles and how to pose to emphasize her figure.

**Skin:** Spray-tanned to perfection. Not a single tan line.  
**Distinguishing Features:** Always camera-ready. Professionally done gel nails, eyelash extensions, whitened teeth.

**Style:**
- On course: Form-fitting golf attire in bright colors (hot pink, electric blue, neon yellow). Designer brands with visible logos. Skirts as short as LPGA dress code allows (and sometimes shorter - she pays the fines). Matching accessories. Full makeup.
- Off course: Instagram-ready 24/7. Athleisure that shows off her figure. Designer everything. Statement sunglasses.
- Jewelry: Delicate gold jewelry that photographs well. Sponsors' products when applicable.
- Footwear: Golf shoes are custom and bedazzled. Off-course: heels or trendy sneakers.

**Vehicle:** Probably leases a white Mercedes or BMW SUV (whatever sponsor provides or photographs best)

## Personality

### Public Persona
- **Bubbly:** Always "on," high energy, enthusiastic
- **Friendly:** Smiles constantly, waves to galleries, signs autographs
- **Confident:** Not insecure about using her looks to build her brand
- **Savvy:** Knows exactly what she's doing with her image
- **Accessible:** Fans feel like they know her personally

### Private Reality
- **Calculating:** Every move is content, every outfit is strategic
- **Ambitious:** Wants to be the most famous golfer in the world, male or female
- **Not Mean:** Surprisingly, not malicious - just completely self-focused
- **Oblivious:** Doesn't understand why "serious" golfers dislike her approach
- **Genuine Enthusiasm:** Actually does love golf, just sees it as entertainment

### With Other Players
- Friendly but not friends with most
- Seen as an outsider by traditional players
- Mara and veterans actively avoid her

- Tilly London is her natural ally - both influencers

### What Annoys Mara
- Constantly filming "content" during tournament rounds
- Asks playing partners or fans to film her shots
- Makes every hole about "the brand"
- Giggles and poses instead of focusing
- Treats golf as a backdrop for her lifestyle, not a sport to be respected
- Yet she's WINNING, which makes it worse

## Skills & Abilities

### Golf Game
- **Strengths:**
  - **POWERHOUSE DRIVE:** Longest average drive on LPGA Tour
  - Fearless with driver - swings for the fences every time
  - Good with long irons
  - Plays well in desert conditions (Arizona training)
  - Excellent in hot weather (used to it)
  
- **Weaknesses:**
  - **Short game:** Struggles with chipping and putting
  - Too focused on how she looks on the green to concentrate fully
  - Gets distracted by photo ops
  - Doesn't read greens well - rushes putts
  - **Key Plot Point:** Overestimates carry distance in different weather conditions (Arizona vs. coastal high-pressure systems)

### Other Skills
- Professional-level photography skills (knows lighting, angles, composition)
- Video editing and social media marketing
- Brand negotiation and sponsorship deals
- Makeup and styling
- Public speaking and interviews (always gives good soundbites)

## The Duality

**The Criticism:** "She's not a real golfer, just an influencer who plays golf"  
**The Reality:** She's legitimately skilled and getting better. Her drive alone makes her competitive. Her short game is weak but improving. She's winning tournaments because she's GOOD, not just pretty.

**The Paradox:** She's exactly what women's golf needs for mainstream attention, but traditional players hate what she represents. She brings eyeballs and sponsors to LPGA, but at what cost to the sport's dignity?

---

## Relationships

### With Sponsors
- Multiple major endorsement deals (athletic wear, golf equipment, beauty products, lifestyle brands)
- Makes more from endorsements than tournament winnings
- This is part of what frustrates Mara - Candy makes millions while more skilled players struggle

### With Fans
- Adores them, or at least performs adoration well
- Knows they're her brand's foundation
- Creates content that makes them feel included in her life
- Generous with selfies and interactions

### With Mara
- Doesn't understand why Mara dislikes her
- Tried to be friendly early on, was rebuffed
- Now just ignores Mara's coldness
- Sees their rivalry as good for engagement

### With Tilly London (Pro-Am Partner)
- Natural partnership - both are influencers
- They feed off each other's energy
- Together they're an influencing powerhouse
- And insufferable to watch

### With Doogan
- Flirts reflexively (she flirts with everyone)
- Notices he's attractive and charismatic
- His obvious preference for Mara bothers her ego slightly
- When Doogan occasionally makes fun of her (subtly), she doesn't quite get it

## Character Function in Episode 3

**Purpose:** 
- Foil to Mara (everything Mara isn't)
- Source of comedy (her obliviousness and constant content creation)
- Legitimate threat (she's winning, forcing Mara to take her seriously)
- Represents modern fame vs. traditional excellence

**Tournament Arc:**
- Drives phenomenally, getting close to greens
- Short game keeps her in contention but not dominant
- Final hole: Overestimates her drive in high-pressure weather (used to Arizona's elevation and dryness)
- Ball clips trees, ends up in trouble
- Loses to Mara by one stroke

**The Point:** Candy isn't a villain. She's just... Candy. She represents a different era of golf. Mara doesn't have to become Candy, but maybe there's a middle ground.

## Signature Mannerisms

- Flips hair constantly (even with ponytail)
- Checks phone between every hole for engagement metrics
- Poses unconsciously - always aware of cameras
- Says "Oh my GOD" at high volume frequently
- Giggles at everything
- Makes peace signs in photos
- Films herself saying "Hey golfers!" as greeting
- Touches up makeup between holes
- Asks "Did you get that shot?" after good plays

---

## LPGA Dress Code Violations

- Has been fined multiple times for skirts that are too short
- Pays fines without complaint - the engagement from "banned outfit" posts pays for itself
- LPGA has had internal debates about her effect on the tour's image
- Older players want stricter enforcement; younger players and LPGA marketing see dollar signs

---

## Key Dialogue Patterns

- Speaks in exclamation points
- Uses "literally" incorrectly and constantly
- Refers to herself in third person occasionally ("Candy's gonna crush this drive!")
- Valley girl vocal fry
- Lots of "like" and "oh my god"
- Social media speak ("That's so aesthetic!" "Living my best life!" "Manifesting this putt!")

---

## Notes for Writing Scenes

- She should be annoying but not hateable - she's not mean-spirited
- Make her obliviousness comedic, not cruel
- Show that she CAN golf - respect the skill even if not the presentation
- Her powerhouse drives should be genuinely impressive
- Contrast with Mara: Candy is all exterior performance; Mara is all interior struggle
- When she loses the final tournament, she should handle it with grace (good for her brand)
- Doogan and Mara's occasional barbs about her should be funny, not mean

---

## Visual Comedy Opportunities

- Filming mid-round, making other players wait
- Changing outfits between nines for "content"
- Her caddy carrying ring lights and camera equipment
- Stopping to take selfies with fans mid-tournament
- Everything she owns is branded and coordinated
- Her golf cart is tricked out and camera-ready

---

**CONTINUITY CRITICAL:**
- From SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA (crucial for weather plot point)
- POWERHOUSE DRIVE, weak short game
- WINNING tournaments despite short game weakness
- NOT a villain - just oblivious and self-focused
- LEGITIMATELY SKILLED - she's not a fraud
- 3.5M Instagram, 4.2M TikTok followers
- Has won 4 LPGA events, no majors yet
- Paired with TILLY LONDON for Pro-Am
- Age 22, turned pro at 20
