## Personality

**Core Traits:**
- Professional and reliable
- Patient and steady
- Observant - notices everything
- Protective of her players
- Honest but tactful
- Dry sense of humor

**With Mara:**
- Knows Mara's game inside and out
- Can read Mara's moods better than anyone
- Knows when Mara needs encouragement vs. technical advice
- Has watched Mara through the injury, pregnancy, comeback
- Protective of Mara as both player and person
- One of the few people Mara trusts completely

**About the Pro-Am Arrangement:**
- Jake approached her with his plan to bring in Doogan
- Initially skeptical - protective of Mara
- Agreed because: (1) She's also worried about Mara's stress level, (2) It's just a Pro-Am so not critical, (3) Jake paid well
- Used her mother's "minor surgery" as cover story (mother is actually fine)
- Feels guilty about the deception but hopes it helps Mara

---

## Personal Life

- Single, never married
- Lives in Florida (near LPGA headquarters area)
- Has caddied for multiple players over career
- Mara is her favorite player she's ever worked with
- Saves money aggressively (caddy income is unpredictable)
- Travels constantly during LPGA season
- Off-season: teaches golf at local courses, does club fitting consultations

---

## Relationship with Mara

**Professional Partnership:**
- 5 years working together
- Developed shorthand communication
- Jenny knows which club Mara wants before she asks
- Tracks Mara's tendencies under different conditions
- Keeps detailed yardage books with notes

**Personal Connection:**
- One of Mara's few real friends on tour
- Has met Alex multiple times
- Sends Alex birthday presents
- Mara trusts Jenny's judgment on and off course
- They can communicate with looks and gestures

**Why the Absence Works:**
- It's just a Pro-Am - not part of LPGA points or rankings
- Players often use substitute caddies for non-tour events
- Jenny's mother's "surgery" seems legitimate
- Mara doesn't question it because Jenny has never let her down before
- Creates space for Doogan without raising suspicion

---

## Relationship with Jake

- Known him for 5 years (since working with Mara)
- Professional relationship but friendly
- He respects her expertise
- She appreciates that he genuinely cares about Mara
- When he approached her about the Doogan plan:
  - She was initially against it
  - He convinced her by focusing on Mara's stress and financial struggles
  - She agreed with conditions: (1) No one gets hurt, (2) If Mara starts to figure it out, Jenny will tell her
  - Jake paid for her "family visit" plus extra compensation
  - They agreed to never tell Mara unless absolutely necessary

---

## Why She Agreed to Step Aside

1. **Worry About Mara:** Has watched Mara become increasingly wound up and serious
2. **Financial Stakes:** Knows Mara is struggling with Hawaii's cost of living
3. **Timing:** Pro-Am is low-pressure, good time to try something
4. **Trust in Jake:** He's always had Mara's best interests at heart
5. **Guilt:** But she still feels terrible about the deception

---

## Character Function

**In Episode 3:**
- Exists mostly off-screen (mentioned but not present)

- Provides cover story (family emergency)
- Could be reached by phone if needed

**Potential Future Use:**
- Could return in later episodes
- Might know more about Doogan's work than she's let on

---

## Notes for Writing

- Jenny is mentioned but not present in Episode 3
- Her absence should feel natural, not suspicious
- If Mara mentions her, it should be matter-of-fact ("Jenny's visiting family")
- Could be texture in dialogue: "Jenny usually reminds me to..." or "My caddy would tell me..."
- Doogan might ask about "the regular caddy" to understand Mara better
- Jenny represents the support system Mara has built - stable, trustworthy

---
