## The Problem He's Solving

**Mara's Talent vs. Marketability Gap:**
- She's playing the best golf of her life
- She has an incredible comeback story (single mom, C-section recovery, Hawaiian heritage)
- She's attractive without being exploitative (unlike Candy)
- She's articulate when she wants to be

**But:**
- She gives terrible interviews - short, technical answers
- She doesn't smile or show personality
- She comes across as cold or disinterested
- Sponsors want someone warm, relatable, inspirational
- They're passing on her for less-talented but more charismatic players

**Jake's Frustration:**
- He can get her mid-tier deals (equipment sponsors, local Hawaiian businesses)
- But the BIG money (national brands, athletic wear, luxury goods) wants personality
- He's tried media training - she just gets more robotic
- He's tried telling her to "be herself" - she doesn't know who that is anymore

## How He Found Eddie and Doogan

**The Charity Golf Tournament:**
- Jake attended a charity golf tournament in Los Angeles
- Eddie was there (networking, making connections)
- They met, got to talking over drinks afterward
- Eddie pitched Jake the idea of the rebound specialist business
- Explained what Doogan does - helping people get out of their own way
- Eddie could tell Jake was struggling with something (probably read it in his body language)
- Jake was skeptical at first but intrigued
- Jake slept on it, did some research (called Eddie's references)
- Decided to take the chance

**The Pitch Jake Made:**
- Contacted Eddie six weeks before Hidden Hills Celebrity Pro-Am
- Explained Mara's situation: brilliant golfer, terrible personality in public
- Jake presented it as: "I need someone to remind her how to be human"
- Not romance (though that's okay), but connection
- Someone who makes her laugh, relaxes her, lets her drop the armor
- If she can show her real personality for even one tournament, he can get it on camera, show it to sponsors
- Negotiated a fee (substantial because Jake is desperate and has budget from Mara's tournament winnings)

**The Setup:**
- Arranged for Jenny to take a "family emergency" week off
- Paid her full rate anyway
- Hired Eddie's firm to provide Doogan as substitute caddy
- **Cover Story:** Doogan "won" the caddy spot in the Sunday night charity auction for women in STEM scholarships
- Backstory fits the event perfectly - makes it seem like happy coincidence
- Told Mara that the auction winner seemed competent (Eddie vetted him)
- Did NOT tell Mara about the rebound specialist angle or that he orchestrated the entire thing

**The Guilt:**
- Feels terrible lying to Mara
- But convinced it's for her own good
- Tells himself it's just "strategic positioning"

---

## The Ethical Gray Area

**What Jake Knows:**
- This is manipulation, even if well-intentioned
- Mara doesn't know she's being "helped"
- If she found out, she'd be furious and feel betrayed
- He's gambling her trust against her future

**Why He Justifies It:**
- She's drowning financially and emotionally
- Her talent deserves recognition and compensation
- He's not trying to change who she is, just surface it
- Every other avenue has failed
- He tells himself it's for Alex - Mara needs financial security for her son

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- How good Doogan is at this
- Whether Mara will actually soften or just feel betrayed later
- If this will blow up in everyone's face

---

## Relationship with Jenny Traverse

**The Caddy Substitution:**
- Jake has known Jenny for years (she's been Mara's caddy for 5 years)
- He approached Jenny with the plan
- Jenny was skeptical but agreed (she's also worried about Mara)
- Jake paid for Jenny's "family visit" back East
- Jenny made it seem natural - told Mara her mother was having minor surgery
- Jenny feels guilty but hopes it works

---

## Character Function in Episode 3

**Setup:**
- Jake is the client who hires Eddie and Doogan
- Provides background on Mara
- Explains the stakes (financial and emotional)
- Observes from distance during tournament

**Throughout:**
- Check-ins with Eddie about progress
- Watches Mara's rounds, notices changes
- Nervous about whether this will work

**Payoff:**
- Watches Mara win tournament
- Sees her give a better interview - she smiles, jokes, shows personality
- Phone starts ringing from sponsors who saw the broadcast
- Feels vindicated but also guilty
- Knows he can never tell Mara the truth

---

## Key Dialogue Patterns

- Speaks in sports metaphors ("We need a Hail Mary here")
- Calls people "chief" or "my friend" when negotiating
- Apologizes before making big asks ("I know this is a lot to ask, but...")
- Talks about his kids to establish common ground
- Self-deprecating about his golf game

---

## Signature Mannerisms

- Checks his phone constantly (managing multiple clients)
- Rubs his temples when stressed
- Takes off his glasses to clean them when thinking
- Drinks too much coffee
- Has a nervous laugh when uncomfortable
- Stands with arms crossed when observing

---

## Notes for Writing Scenes

- He should be likeable despite the ethical issues
- His love for Mara (as client/friend) should be evident
- Show the toll this secrecy takes on him
- He's not a villain - he's desperate and out of options
- His family grounds him - references to Linda and the kids show he's a good man in a gray situation
- When he watches Mara succeed, show both pride and guilt

---

**CONTINUITY CRITICAL:**

- Met Eddie at CHARITY GOLF TOURNAMENT in LA
