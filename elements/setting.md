# Setting: Pacific Point

## Overview
Pacific Point is a vibrant coastal city nestled along the sun-kissed shores of Southern California. Inspired by the allure of Malibu, Pacific Point blends natural beauty with a laid-back yet luxurious lifestyle, making it the perfect backdrop for stories of ambition, romance, and intrigue.

## Geography
The city stretches along a rugged coastline where golden beaches meet dramatic cliffs. To the east, rolling hills dotted with modern villas and lush vineyards rise gently, offering panoramic views of the sparkling Pacific Ocean. Hidden coves and scenic hiking trails provide a sense of adventure and seclusion.

## Climate
Pacific Point enjoys a Mediterranean climate characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, breezy winters. Sunshine dominates most days, painting the skies in hues of orange and pink during breathtaking sunsets. Occasional marine fog drifts inland, adding a mysterious veil to early mornings.

## Culture
The culture of Pacific Point is a fusion of artistic creativity and upscale sophistication. Art galleries, boutique shops, and organic cafés line the palm-shaded streets. Surf culture thrives alongside high-end fashion, and weekend farmers’ markets showcase local produce and artisanal goods. Residents value wellness, sustainability, and outdoor living.

## Atmosphere
Life in Pacific Point moves at a relaxed yet purposeful pace. The rhythmic sound of waves crashing against the shore harmonizes with distant laughter from beach bonfires. At night, the city glows softly under starlit skies, with ocean breezes carrying the scent of salt air. It's a place where dreams feel tangible, and every corner whispers a story waiting to unfold.
## Cultural Details

### Transportation & Car Culture
- **Driving is essential:** Nearly everyone drives their own car. Public transit exists but is rarely used except by those without other options.
- **Valet parking:** Common at nicer restaurants, hotels, and venues. Tips expected.
- **Rideshare dominance:** Uber and Lyft are the default for anyone without a car or drinking. Hailing traditional taxis is virtually unheard of—this isn't New York.
- **Freeway references:** Locals use "the" before freeway numbers ("the 101," "the 405," "the PCH").
- **Traffic reality:** Rush hour runs 7-10 AM and 3-7 PM, but traffic can happen anytime. Commute times are long but considered normal.
- **Parking:** Always a consideration. Street parking, meters, lots, structures—everyone has strategies.

### Social Norms
- **Casual sophistication:** Even upscale venues have a relaxed vibe. Dress codes exist but lean toward "elevated casual."
- **Outdoor living:** Year-round sunshine means outdoor dining, rooftop bars, and beach gatherings are standard.
- **Wellness culture:** Juice bars, farmers' markets, yoga studios, hiking trails—health and fitness are woven into daily life.
- **Industry presence:** Entertainment industry is everywhere; actors waiting tables, writers at coffee shops, producers at farmer's markets.
- **Late dining:** Dinner reservations at 8 or 9 PM are common; the city runs later than many other U.S. metros.
