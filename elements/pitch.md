# The Rebound Specialist

## Logline
In a sun-bleached Southern California beach town, Doogan Andrews makes his living as a discreet “rebound specialist”—a charming, temporary boyfriend hired to help people move on—until he wakes up beside a dead woman and becomes the easiest suspect in the room. To clear his name, he and his hustler best friend Eddie have to unmask the client who set him up before a homicide detective decides Doogan isn’t just morally questionable—he’s criminal.

## The Premise
Doogan is good at two things: reading people and pretending he isn’t. That talent became a business. Eddie Palmer—the fast-talking pitchman who can sell a lie like it’s a public service—books the jobs. Doogan does the work in the field: conversation, chemistry, carefully engineered closure.

Their rules keep it from sliding fully into sleaze:
- Targets are never humiliated, coerced, or “handled.” The goal is dignity and forward motion.
- The team never tells a target they were hired.
- If a job smells like adultery, abuse, or revenge, they walk.

Which is why the new client feels wrong immediately.

## The Inciting Crime
After a suspiciously clean “receptionist rebound,” Doogan blacks out and wakes up in bed next to the target—dead. The supposed CEO who hired them is unfindable. The company paperwork leads to shell fronts. The job wasn’t a rebound; it was a setup.

Detective Paul Martinez, an ethical homicide detective with a deadpan streak and no patience for Doogan’s profession, puts Doogan in his sights. Doogan can’t tell the truth without admitting what he does for a living—and he can’t lie his way out without looking guiltier.

## The Series Engine (How Episodes Work)
Each installment delivers a complete “rebound job” with its own comedic mini-arc—wedding weekend disasters, country-club theatrics, public-facing celebrity meltdowns—while the investigation advances through a clue, a complication, or a new layer of the conspiracy.

The tone stays fast and dialogue-driven: breezy, witty, slightly dark, with satire aimed at wealth, institutions, and the stories people buy about themselves.

## Season Arc (Episode 1 → Finale)
Framed for murder, Doogan and Eddie scramble to keep the business alive long enough to pay for lawyers and keep Martinez off their backs. With Abby (Eddie’s razor-smart wife and reluctant operations boss) and Baxter (an eighteen-year-old tech prodigy who can hack anything except a normal conversation) they dig into a medical/insurance con that’s bigger than a single corpse.

Every answer creates a new problem: evidence gets erased in real time, witnesses disappear, and the team realizes the framing wasn’t an accident—it’s part of a bigger cleanup.

The endgame is simple: find the real architect, prove motive and method, and force the system to look in the right direction—before the system decides it’s easier to make an example out of Doogan.

## Why This Sells
The Rebound Specialist combines a high-concept hook (a professional “rebound” framed for murder) with a repeatable episodic engine (relationship fixes with comedic payoff) and a propulsive conspiracy spine. It’s built for serialized release: short installments, strong scene momentum, and cliffhangers that land.

## Comps
In the spirit of Gregory McDonald’s *Fletch*: sharp, funny, dialogue-forward crime with a charismatic lead who talks as fast as trouble arrives.
