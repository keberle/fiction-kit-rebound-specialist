# Writer Checklist: The Rebound Specialist

Quick reference checklist for scenes, voice, and formatting.

- **POV:** Third-person limited, aligned to Doogan's perceptions and sensibility.
- **The Fletch Rule:** Reader learns information when Doogan learns itno villain POV, no omniscient narration.
- **Off-Screen Events:** Never dramatize scenes where Doogan isn't present. Use indirect delivery: dialogue recounting, Eddie/Baxter briefings, documents, voicemails, interviews, news clips.
- **Information Flow:** If Doogan didn't witness it, the reader learns about it through reported action, not direct dramatization.
- **Dialogue-Driven:** Aim for dialogue to carry 8090% of scene momentum; use action beats to anchor.
- **Tags & Beats:** Insert a tag or action beat after no more than three consecutive untagged lines; in multi-character scenes avoid more than five consecutive untagged lines.
- **New Speaker:** New paragraph for each speaker.
- **Tag Tone:** Prefer neutral tags (`said`). Reserve vivid verbs for visible actions in beats, not tags.
- **Secrecy Rule:** Never reveal to a target that they were hired or paid to be rebounded.
- **Tone & Mood:** Fast, witty, and slightly satirical; mood can shift light to dark to light quickly.
- **Length & Pacing:** Installments: ~2,0006,000 words; scenes should advance plot or character and avoid filler.
- **Clarity Check:** Can a reader follow the exchange with no tags/beats? If not, add the minimal beat or tag needed for clarity.
- **Character Consistency:** Use canonical names and recurring beats (Cougar callback, Doogan rituals) consistently.
- **Avoid:** Long explanatory narration; don't over-explain jokes or inside references; no villain monologues or confession scenes.

Use this checklist while drafting and during final pass edits to keep scenes consistent with series voice and rules.
