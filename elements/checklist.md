# Writer Checklist: The Rebound Specialist

Quick reference checklist for scenes, voice, and formatting.

## POV & Information Flow Rules
- **POV (Ensemble Third-Person Close):** Third-person close with a single POV anchor per scene. Default POV is Doogan, but the story may use **team POV scenes** (Eddie/Abby/Baxter) when the team is acting away from Doogan.
- **No First-Person:** NEVER use first-person ("I," "my," "me") in narrative.
- **One Head Per Scene:** No head-hopping. Establish the POV character early and stay in that character’s perceptions.
- **Third-Person Close Feel:** Stay tight to the POV character’s consciousness—what they see, hear, notice—without interior monologue dumps or authorial commentary.
- **Fair-Play Rule (Team Edition):** The reader learns clues when **a POV character** learns them. Still no villain POV and no omniscient reveals of antagonist actions.
- **Off-Screen Events:** Never dramatize scenes where **no core POV character** is present. Use indirect delivery (dialogue recounting, briefings, documents, voicemails, interviews, news clips).
- **Information Flow:** If the POV character didn’t witness it, the reader learns it through reported action, not omniscient narration.
- **Character Knowledge Boundaries:** Characters can ONLY know what they've been told, researched, or witnessed directly. Never include details about other characters that the POV character couldn't possibly know yet.
- **Scene Spoiling Prevention:** Each scene should have its own dramatic purpose. Scene A should NOT reveal information that is Scene B's primary purpose to deliver. Tease or set up the next scene without spoiling it.

## Scene Opening Rules (CRITICAL — McDonald Style)
- **No Atmospheric Openers:** NEVER open with metaphorical description ("The kitchen smelled of lemongrass and poor decisions"). This is an automatic rewrite trigger.
- **Dialogue-First:** Scenes open with dialogue already in progress or a character mid-action.
- **The Eavesdropper Test:** Reader should feel they're overhearing a conversation that started before they arrived.
- **Start Late:** Enter scenes as late as possible. Skip greetings, arrivals, pleasantries unless they serve plot.

## Character Detail Rules (CRITICAL)
- **Source Verification:** Before writing ANY detail about a character (occupation, background, possessions, relationships), CHECK the character file in `elements/characters/` first.
- **Timeline Awareness:** Consider WHEN in the story timeline the scene occurs. What does the POV character know at THIS point?
- **No Invented Backstory:** If a character file doesn't specify a detail (job, hometown, wealth source, education), DO NOT invent it. Leave vague or have characters explicitly state they don't know.
- **Villain/Antagonist Caution:** Be especially careful with antagonist details—many may be lies, false identities, or unknowable to protagonists at early story stages.
- **Research Results Only:** If Baxter/team hasn't researched it yet, the characters don't know it. If they claim to know something, show where that intel came from.
- **Anti-Pattern Sections:** Many character files contain anti-pattern sections (Fashion Anti-Patterns, Motor-Mouth Rules, Home Environment Rules). These are HARD RULES, not suggestions.

## Character-Specific Rules (CRITICAL)

### Eddie Palmer (Motor-Mouth Style)
- ✅ Often mid-sentence when scenes begin
- ✅ Steamrolls other characters, cuts them off with em-dashes
- ✅ Tangents that ALWAYS circle back to land the point
- ✅ Multiple unfinished conversational threads
- ❌ NEVER structured turn-taking dialogue
- ❌ NEVER short, punchy responses (that's Doogan)
- ❌ NEVER waiting to be addressed before speaking
- See: `elements/characters/eddie-palmer.md` → Motor-Mouth Dialogue Rules

### Abby Palmer (Elevated Style)
- ✅ Silk blouses, tailored linen, designer casual even at home
- ✅ Home is modern, curated, stylish (quartz counters, fresh flowers)
- ❌ NEVER yoga pants or athleisure as casual wear
- ❌ NEVER "lived-in" messy home (mail stacks, fridge clutter)
- See: `elements/characters/abby-palmer.md` → Fashion Anti-Patterns, Home Environment Rules

### Doogan Andrews (Measured Drawl)
- ✅ Short responses, dry delivery, self-deprecating
- ✅ Measured Southern drawl when relaxed
- ✅ Precise and professional when working
- ❌ NEVER rambling or motor-mouth style (that's Eddie)

## Dialogue & Style Rules
- **Dialogue-Driven:** Aim for dialogue to carry 80–90% of scene momentum; use action beats to anchor.
- **Tags & Beats:** Insert a tag or action beat after no more than three consecutive untagged lines; in multi-character scenes avoid more than five consecutive untagged lines.
- **New Speaker:** New paragraph for each speaker.
- **Tag Tone:** Prefer neutral tags (`said`). Reserve vivid verbs for visible actions in beats, not tags.
- **Secrecy Rule:** Never reveal to a target that they were hired or paid to be rebounded.

## Research/Investigation Scene Rules (CRITICAL FOR MYSTERY PLOTS)
- **No Invented Research Results:** When characters research other characters, results MUST come from element files
- **Empty Is Valid:** If information isn't documented in element files, the research comes up EMPTY
- **Check Timeline:** Review "What Team Knows & When" sections in character files for timeline-aware discoveries
- **Mystery Integrity:** Antagonists and mystery characters are often MEANT to be hard to research—honor that
- **Do Not Invent:** NEVER create employers, companies, LinkedIn profiles, social media content, or background data not in files
- **Absence Is Plot:** "Can't find anything useful" is often the CORRECT and story-serving research result
- **Verify Before Writing:** Before writing ANY research dialogue, check: "Does this info exist in an element file?"

## Tone & Pacing Rules
- **Tone & Mood:** Fast, witty, and slightly satirical; mood can shift light to dark to light quickly.
- **Length & Pacing:** Installments: ~2,000–6,000 words; scenes should advance plot or character and avoid filler.
- **Clarity Check:** Can a reader follow the exchange with no tags/beats? If not, add the minimal beat or tag needed for clarity.

## Consistency Rules
- **Character Consistency:** Use canonical names and recurring beats (Cougar callback, Doogan rituals) consistently.
- **Avoid:** Long explanatory narration; don't over-explain jokes or inside references; no villain monologues or confession scenes.

## Pre-Writing Verification Checklist
Before writing ANY scene, verify:
1. ✓ Does the opening pass the McDonald Eavesdropper Test? (No atmospheric openers)
2. ✓ Is this in third-person close for the scene’s POV character? (No "I" or "my")
3. ✓ Is the POV anchor clear by paragraph one (and maintained)?
4. ✓ What does the POV character know at this point in the timeline?
5. ✓ Have I checked character files for ALL characters mentioned?
6. ✓ Have I reviewed anti-pattern sections in character files? (Fashion, Voice, Home Environment)
7. ✓ Am I inventing any details not in the character files? (If yes, STOP)
8. ✓ Could this character realistically know this information right now?
9. ✓ If they know it, did I show where the intel came from?
10. ✓ Does this scene spoil the next scene's dramatic purpose? (If yes, withhold and tease instead)
11. ✓ Does each character's dialogue match their Voice & Style section?
12. ✓ What is THIS scene's unique purpose, and does every beat serve it?13. ✓ **[NEW] BEAT MECHANISM VERIFICATION:**
    - For EACH outline beat, have I verified HOW/WHY it happens?
    - If beat says "Character X is there" → Have I verified HOW they know to come?
    - If beat says "Character knows Y" → Have I verified the information source?
    - Have I checked notes.md for established mechanisms (procedures, phone calls, etc.)?
    - Have I documented the mechanism in my continuity notes?
    - If mechanism is unclear, have I FLAGGED IT instead of inventing?
14. ✓ **[NEW] MISSING DETAIL VERIFICATION:**
    - Do I need ANY detail for this scene that is NOT in element files?
    - Physical descriptions, backgrounds, possessions, locations, motivations?
    - Have I created "❓ MISSING DETAILS - USER INPUT NEEDED" section?
    - Have I listed ALL missing details with questions for user?
    - Am I waiting for user response instead of inventing?
    - **NEVER proceed with scene if details are missing**
Use this checklist while drafting and during final pass edits to keep scenes consistent with series voice and rules.
