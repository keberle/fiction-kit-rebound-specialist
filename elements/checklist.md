# Writer Checklist: The Rebound Specialist

Quick reference checklist for scenes, voice, and formatting.

## POV & Information Flow Rules
- **POV:** Third-person close for all scenes where Doogan is present ("Doogan said," "He noticed," "His thumb traced circles"). NEVER use first-person ("I," "my," "me").
- **Third-Person Close Feel:** Stay tight to Doogan's consciousness—what he sees, hears, notices—without interior monologue or authorial commentary.
- **The Fletch Rule:** Reader learns information when Doogan learns it—no villain POV, no omniscient narration.
- **Off-Screen Events:** Never dramatize scenes where Doogan isn't present. Use indirect delivery: dialogue recounting, Eddie/Baxter briefings, documents, voicemails, interviews, news clips.
- **Information Flow:** If Doogan didn't witness it, the reader learns about it through reported action, not direct dramatization.
- **Character Knowledge Boundaries:** Characters can ONLY know what they've been told, researched, or witnessed directly. Never include details about other characters that the POV character couldn't possibly know yet.
- **Scene Spoiling Prevention:** Each scene should have its own dramatic purpose. Scene A should NOT reveal information that is Scene B's primary purpose to deliver. Tease or set up the next scene without spoiling it.

## Scene Opening Rules (CRITICAL — McDonald Style)
- **No Atmospheric Openers:** NEVER open with metaphorical description ("The kitchen smelled of lemongrass and poor decisions"). This is an automatic rewrite trigger.
- **Dialogue-First:** Scenes open with dialogue already in progress or a character mid-action.
- **The Eavesdropper Test:** Reader should feel they're overhearing a conversation that started before they arrived.
- **Start Late:** Enter scenes as late as possible. Skip greetings, arrivals, pleasantries unless they serve plot.

## Character Detail Rules (CRITICAL)
- **Source Verification:** Before writing ANY detail about a character (occupation, background, possessions, relationships), CHECK the character file in `elements/characters/` first.
- **Timeline Awareness:** Consider WHEN in the story timeline the scene occurs. What does the POV character know at THIS point?
- **No Invented Backstory:** If a character file doesn't specify a detail (job, hometown, wealth source, education), DO NOT invent it. Leave vague or have characters explicitly state they don't know.
- **Villain/Antagonist Caution:** Be especially careful with antagonist details—many may be lies, false identities, or unknowable to protagonists at early story stages.
- **Research Results Only:** If Baxter/team hasn't researched it yet, the characters don't know it. If they claim to know something, show where that intel came from.
- **Anti-Pattern Sections:** Many character files contain anti-pattern sections (Fashion Anti-Patterns, Motor-Mouth Rules, Home Environment Rules). These are HARD RULES, not suggestions.

## Character-Specific Rules (CRITICAL)

### Eddie Palmer (Motor-Mouth Style)
- ✅ Often mid-sentence when scenes begin
- ✅ Steamrolls other characters, cuts them off with em-dashes
- ✅ Tangents that ALWAYS circle back to land the point
- ✅ Multiple unfinished conversational threads
- ❌ NEVER structured turn-taking dialogue
- ❌ NEVER short, punchy responses (that's Doogan)
- ❌ NEVER waiting to be addressed before speaking
- See: `elements/characters/eddie-palmer.md` → Motor-Mouth Dialogue Rules

### Abby Palmer (Elevated Style)
- ✅ Silk blouses, tailored linen, designer casual even at home
- ✅ Home is modern, curated, stylish (quartz counters, fresh flowers)
- ❌ NEVER yoga pants or athleisure as casual wear
- ❌ NEVER "lived-in" messy home (mail stacks, fridge clutter)
- See: `elements/characters/abby-palmer.md` → Fashion Anti-Patterns, Home Environment Rules

### Doogan Andrews (Measured Drawl)
- ✅ Short responses, dry delivery, self-deprecating
- ✅ Measured Southern drawl when relaxed
- ✅ Precise and professional when working
- ❌ NEVER rambling or motor-mouth style (that's Eddie)

## Dialogue & Style Rules
- **Dialogue-Driven:** Aim for dialogue to carry 80–90% of scene momentum; use action beats to anchor.
- **Tags & Beats:** Insert a tag or action beat after no more than three consecutive untagged lines; in multi-character scenes avoid more than five consecutive untagged lines.
- **New Speaker:** New paragraph for each speaker.
- **Tag Tone:** Prefer neutral tags (`said`). Reserve vivid verbs for visible actions in beats, not tags.
- **Secrecy Rule:** Never reveal to a target that they were hired or paid to be rebounded.

## Research/Investigation Scene Rules (CRITICAL FOR MYSTERY PLOTS)
- **No Invented Research Results:** When characters research other characters, results MUST come from element files
- **Empty Is Valid:** If information isn't documented in element files, the research comes up EMPTY
- **Check Timeline:** Review "What Team Knows & When" sections in character files for timeline-aware discoveries
- **Mystery Integrity:** Antagonists and mystery characters are often MEANT to be hard to research—honor that
- **Do Not Invent:** NEVER create employers, companies, LinkedIn profiles, social media content, or background data not in files
- **Absence Is Plot:** "Can't find anything useful" is often the CORRECT and story-serving research result
- **Verify Before Writing:** Before writing ANY research dialogue, check: "Does this info exist in an element file?"

## Tone & Pacing Rules
- **Tone & Mood:** Fast, witty, and slightly satirical; mood can shift light to dark to light quickly.
- **Length & Pacing:** Installments: ~2,000–6,000 words; scenes should advance plot or character and avoid filler.
- **Clarity Check:** Can a reader follow the exchange with no tags/beats? If not, add the minimal beat or tag needed for clarity.

## Consistency Rules
- **Character Consistency:** Use canonical names and recurring beats (Cougar callback, Doogan rituals) consistently.
- **Avoid:** Long explanatory narration; don't over-explain jokes or inside references; no villain monologues or confession scenes.

## Pre-Writing Verification Checklist
Before writing ANY scene, verify:
1. ✓ Does the opening pass the McDonald Eavesdropper Test? (No atmospheric openers)
2. ✓ Is this in third-person close? (No "I" or "my"—use "Doogan," "he," "his")
3. ✓ What does the POV character know at this point in the timeline?
4. ✓ Have I checked character files for ALL characters mentioned?
5. ✓ Have I reviewed anti-pattern sections in character files? (Fashion, Voice, Home Environment)
6. ✓ Am I inventing any details not in the character files? (If yes, STOP)
7. ✓ Could this character realistically know this information right now?
8. ✓ If they know it, did I show where the intel came from?
9. ✓ Does this scene spoil the next scene's dramatic purpose? (If yes, withhold and tease instead)
10. ✓ Does each character's dialogue match their Voice & Style section?
11. ✓ What is THIS scene's unique purpose, and does every beat serve it?

Use this checklist while drafting and during final pass edits to keep scenes consistent with series voice and rules.
