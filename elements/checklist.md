# Writer Checklist: The Rebound Specialist

Story-specific constraints. Read with `voice/` files for complete rules.

## The Secrecy Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Targets NEVER know they're part of a paid rebound operation.**

### Red Flag Words (in target dialogue about Doogan)
- "paid" / "pay" / "hiring" / "hire"
- "job" (ANY context when target addresses Doogan)
- "babysit" / "service" / "charge" / "cost"
- "professional" (re: Doogan's interpersonal skills)

**If any appear in target dialogue, scene must be rewritten.**

### Acceptable Skepticism (within cover story)
- ✅ "You're being nice because my parents asked you to"
- ✅ "You're here doing a favor for them"
- ✅ "You're too perfect. This feels like a setup."
- ❌ "My parents paid you to babysit me"
- ❌ "Is this your job?"

## Operational Security

Team (Eddie/Doogan/Abby/Baxter) **NEVER reveals** to outsiders:
- Client relationships
- Business model
- Paid investigation details

**Cover for cops:** "Helping my friend who's accused of murder"

## Pre-Writing Verification

1. ✓ Does opening pass McDonald Eavesdropper Test?
2. ✓ Third-person close, POV anchor clear by paragraph one?
3. ✓ What does POV character know at this point?
4. ✓ Checked ALL character files for characters in scene?
5. ✓ Checked anti-pattern sections?
6. ✓ Am I inventing any details? (If yes, STOP)
7. ✓ Did I verify HOW each beat happens?
8. ✓ Does scene spoil next scene's purpose?
