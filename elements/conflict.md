## Core Conflicts

### 1. Doogan vs. The Conspiracy
- **External:** Doogan is repeatedly framed for murder as he investigates a complex fraud ring involving clinics, pharmacies, and insurance companies (Theta Health).
- **Escalation:** Each episode reveals new layers—dead bodies, erased evidence, and powerful adversaries who always seem one step ahead.
- **Goal:** Clear his name, expose the scam, and survive the increasingly dangerous game.

### 2. Doogan vs. Law Enforcement (Martinez)
- **External:** Detective Martinez suspects Doogan, alternating between adversary and reluctant ally.
- **Escalation:** Martinez’s investigations threaten Doogan’s freedom, but also provide clues and pressure that move the case forward.
- **Goal:** Stay out of jail, earn Martinez’s trust, and use their rivalry to uncover the truth.

### 3. Doogan vs. His Own Reputation
- **Internal/External:** Doogan’s rebound-for-hire business is unconventional and often misunderstood, making him an easy target for suspicion and ridicule.
- **Escalation:** The stigma of his profession complicates his relationships with clients, friends, and authorities, and is weaponized by the real criminals.
- **Goal:** Prove his worth, maintain his integrity, and keep his business afloat.

### 4. Team Dynamics (Eddie, Abby, Baxter)
- **Interpersonal:** The team’s loyalty is tested by danger, mistrust, and personal stakes.
- **Escalation:** Friends are forced to lie, hack, and manipulate to protect Doogan and solve the case, risking their own safety and relationships.
- **Goal:** Stay united, leverage each member’s strengths, and navigate the tension between personal risk and group loyalty.

### 5. Doogan vs. Himself
- **Internal:** Doogan’s humor masks anxiety, guilt, and self-doubt as the stakes rise.
- **Escalation:** Each setback forces him to question his methods, motives, and ability to protect those he cares about.
- **Goal:** Maintain composure, adapt under pressure, and grow as a leader and friend.

## Maintaining Conflict for LLM Storytelling

- **Keep Doogan under pressure:**  
  - He should never feel fully safe or in control; the conspiracy adapts to his moves.
- **Let relationships complicate the investigation:**  
  - Friends, clients, and adversaries all have conflicting agendas.
- **Escalate stakes with each clue:**  
  - Every answer leads to a bigger question or a new danger.
- **Balance external threats with internal struggles:**  
  - Show how Doogan’s humor and charm are both weapons and shields.
- **Use reversals and surprises:**  
  - Allies may betray, evidence may vanish, and victories may backfire.
