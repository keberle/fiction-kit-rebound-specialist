## Executive Summary

Episode 3 lacks the kinetic energy and emotional immediacy of Episodes 1 and 2. The storytelling has become **expository** rather than **experiential**. You're **telling** instead of **showing**, and worst of all, you've started **explaining** instead of **trusting**.

> "The road to hell is paved with adverbs." — Stephen King, *On Writing*

This episode's road is paved with something worse: authorial commentary masquerading as prose.

## The Core Problem: Manufacturing vs. Discovery

### What Made Episodes 1 & 2 Work

**Episode 1, Scene 1 ("The Dumping"):**
- Opens mid-conversation: *"I think we should stop seeing each other."*
- Every line of dialogue does work—reveals character, advances relationship, lands emotional truth
- Dessert menu joke shows Doogan deflecting pain (character *doing* something)
- Claire's "hand thing" observation—specific, behavioral, real
- "You're going to destroy them" / "You're going to walk into that hearing and win"—language is simple, direct, honest

**Episode 2, Scene 6 ("Country Club Kickoff"):**
- Opens with Terry mid-rant: *"No no no, that's the groomsmen staging area..."*
- Character voice so strong you hear it
- Scavenger hunt clue is a *puzzle*—we discover with Doogan
- Cheryl skeptical but curious—real human dynamic
- Baxter's voice in ear creates tension (tech doing work, not explaining work)

**What you were doing right:**
- Dialogue-driven (80%+ spoken words)
- Situations felt *discovered*, not *manufactured*
- Characters behaved like people, not plot puppets
- Minimal scene-setting, maximum eavesdropping
- Emotional honesty through physical detail and speech patterns

### What's Gone Wrong in Episode 3

**Scene 1 ("The Rebound Brief"):**

You open with dialogue, which is good. But then:

> "Eddie addressed his ball, knees bent, club head hovering. The fourteenth tee box at Willow Creek overlooked the fairway sloping toward distant greens. Sunday afternoon sun painted the course gold."

This is **atmospheric description**. This is the author setting a scene instead of dropping the reader into action already happening.

**McDonald Opening Rule Violation:** You've set up the scene for the reader instead of trusting them to figure it out from dialogue and context clues.

**Better opening (McDonald style):**
> "—come on, Jake. We're the ones to handle this situation. The basics will be figured out over time. We can get straight to the inner details."  
>   
> Eddie swung. Clean contact. Ball arced high, dropped center fairway.  
>   
> Jake stood three feet back, arms crossed. "You make it sound simple."

You don't need *"The fourteenth tee box at Willow Creek overlooked..."*—that's tour guide narration. The reader doesn't care where they are yet. They care about **what's being said** and **what's at stake**.

---

**Scene 2 ("The Clinic Visit"):**

This scene is **almost entirely exposition**. Abby goes to clinic, gets caught snooping. But there's no *discovery*—it's a heist scene with no stakes because we're watching someone execute a plan poorly.

The Baxter earpiece bit:
> "Okay, these are barrel locks so you need to bend one into an L-shape for tension, and the other—"  
> "Wait." Abby froze. "Do you actually know how to pick locks?"  
> "Um...kind of..."  
> "What does 'kind of' mean?"  
> Pause. "I'm... reading about it. Right now."

This is cute. It's funny. **But it's sitcom dialogue, not story tension.** The humor deflates the stakes instead of raising them. When Abby says *"Are we really going to learn lock-picking together while I'm actively breaking into a medical records room?"*—she's *commenting on the scene* like she's watching herself in a TV show.

**What's missing:** Physical sensation. Fear. The body responding to danger.

King would ask: *Where is her pulse? Where is the sweat on her palms? Where is the physical reality of breaking into a medical facility?*

You write:
> "Footsteps in the hallway outside. Abby's pulse spiked."

That's **telling**. You're *asserting* fear instead of *showing* it.

**King approach:**
> Footsteps in the hallway. Abby's hands went still. Cold sweat at her collar.

**Two details.** Hands stop moving (behavior). Sweat (physical sensation). The reader *feels* the fear instead of being *told* about it.

---

**Scene 3 ("Welcome Gala & Auction"):**

This is where the episode goes completely off the rails.

You open:
> "—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen, I'll see if I can get you an hour driving the ball return cart on the range while Candy is warming up." Harry Halligan said to a captive audience chuckled along.

Good McDonald opening! But then:

> "A man in a tailored tuxedo nodded while holding up his paddle."

Who is this man? Why does he matter? The reader has no idea. You're describing people like a camera panning a room.

Then:
> "A loud applause broke out across a who's who of Southern California hollywood and LPGA royalty, all dressed to the nines and well lubricated."

This is **summary**. You're *telling* us what kind of people are here instead of letting us *see* them through specific details.

**King's "Show Don't Tell":**
- ❌ BAD: "well lubricated" (abstract description)
- ✅ GOOD: Show someone stumbling, slurring, laughing too loud

You write:
> "Doogan spotted Mara sitting at a table with two members of a hit tv show and their spouses along with her manager Jake and a few people he didn't recognize."

**This is a camera establishing shot.** Doogan isn't *doing* anything. He's *observing* from a distance, and the author is using him as an excuse to *describe the room*.

**What's missing:** Doogan moving through space with intention. Physical action that reveals character.

---

**Scene 5 ("Golf Fun Day"):**

Opens strong:
> "Mother fu-"

**Brilliant.** Mid-profanity. Brenda already in action, already frustrated. This is pure McDonald.

But then you can't help yourself:
> "It wasn't hard to find this crew," Doogan said as he approached, watching a small patch of grass and with the tee still embedded flop out from the ad hoc driving range setup beside the Hidden Hills clubhouse.

The sentence is clunky, over-described, and it **steps on your great opening**. You opened with action (Brenda's profanity) and then immediately shifted to Doogan observing and narrating.

**King's 2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10% Rule:**

Cut that entire sentence. You don't need it. Brenda's profanity + the next line of dialogue tells us everything.

---

**Scene 8 ("Post-Tournament Dinner Invitation"):**

> "I owe it all to my amazing caddy, Winston" Brenda beamed and gestured to Winston to join her.

**"Beamed"** is an authorial emotion interpretation. It's you *telling* the reader Brenda is happy instead of *showing* happiness through behavior.

**Forbidden pattern detected:**
- ❌ "beamed" → ✅ "smiled" or "grinned" or "laughed"

The word "beamed" is the author *interpreting* Brenda's emotional state for the reader. Trust the reader to see that gesture and hear that dialogue and understand she's happy.

Later:
> "Jake stood off towards the edge of the media, smiling triumphantly before looking over at Doogan and mouthing 'thank you'."

**"Smiling triumphantly"** — another authorial emotion interpretation.

**Better:** "Jake smiled. Mouthed 'thank you.'"

Let the reader infer triumph from context (successful media interaction, gratitude to Doogan). Don't do the reader's emotional work for them.

---

**Scene 9 ("Baxter Goes Undercover"):**

> "The temp receptionist looked up from her phone. Young, bored, probably covering someone's shift."

**"Young, bored, probably covering someone's shift"** — this is the author *guessing* about a character instead of *showing* her through behavior.

You're editorializing. You're filling in details that the POV character (Baxter) wouldn't necessarily know or think about in this moment.

**King approach:**
> The temp looked up from her phone. "Can I help you?"

That's it. Let her behavior (looking up from phone, minimal engagement) convey that she's young and bored. The reader will infer "probably covering someone's shift" without you saying it.

---

**Scene 12 ("Quiet Dinner"):**

This scene has good bones—Doogan and Mara connecting, her vulnerability about Alex—but you keep stepping on emotional moments with **explanatory clauses**.

You write:
> "I was on tour, and..." She shrugged. "Life happened."

Good! Sparse. Honest. Real.

But then:
> "You're doing what you need to do."  
> "Am I?" She looked at him. "Or am I just choosing my career over my son?"  
> "You're providing for him. That's not choosing your career. That's being his mother."  
> She held his gaze, then looked away. "That's a nice way to say it."

This dialogue is **on-the-nose**. They're *saying* what the scene is about instead of *living* it.

**King's rule: Theme emerges from story—don't start with a message.**

Mara's struggle (career vs. motherhood) is a **theme**. But when characters *discuss the theme directly*, it feels like the author lecturing through dialogue instead of characters being human.

**More honest approach:**
> "I was on tour, and..." She shrugged. "Life happened."  
> "You were scared."  
> "Terrified. And now I'm thirty-four. Three, four good seasons left if I'm lucky. And I'm spending half of them flying back and forth to Maui."

Stop there. Don't have Doogan *solve* her emotional conflict with reassuring dialogue. Let it sit. Let the reader *feel* the tension she's living with. That's more powerful than Doogan saying the right thing.

---

## The Deeper Issue: Manufactured Plot

**Episode 3 is plot-driven instead of character-driven.**

In Episodes 1 and 2, you had:
- Doogan getting dumped (emotional, real, human)
- Wedding weekend with Cheryl (situational tension, natural chemistry, increasing stakes)
- Clinic investigation emerging organically from Tilly's death

In Episode 3, you have:
- Doogan hired to make Mara smile (too abstract)
- Golf tournament as *backdrop* (not situation with tension)
- Investigation happening off-screen while Doogan caddies

**The golf tournament doesn't have inherent dramatic stakes.** It's a charity Pro-Am. Mara's playing well. There's no competition pressure, no rival to defeat, no crisis to overcome. It's just... golf.

**King's belief: Story is everything. Technique serves story, not the reverse.**

You're writing scenes because the outline says to write them, not because the situation is generating dramatic tension.

---

## Specific Technical Failures (Hard Fails)

### 1. Adverb Abuse (Mild but Present)

**Scene 3:**
> "A loud applause broke out"

"Loud" is unnecessary. Applause is inherently audible. Either it's applause or it's not. The modifier doesn't add meaning.

**Scene 8:**
> "smiling triumphantly"

Adverb + emotional interpretation. Double violation.

**Scene 12:**
> "quietly" (referring to voices on earpiece)

Delete. If Baxter's voice is coming through an earpiece, we assume it's quiet relative to the room.

---

### 2. Passive Voice (Scattered Throughout)

**Scene 2:**
> "The receptionist slid the clipboard across the counter."

Active. Good.

But then:
> "Abby was returned the clipboard."

Passive construction. Should be: "Abby returned the clipboard."

**Scene 9:**
> "Nancy stood in the doorway, purse still over her shoulder, eyes locked on him."

"Eyes locked" is passive phrasing. Better: "Nancy stood in the doorway, purse over her shoulder, watching him."

---

### 3. Dialogue Attribution Violations

You do well with "said" throughout most scenes. But:

**Scene 8:**
> "Brenda beamed"

Not dialogue attribution but action beat functioning as one. "Beamed" isn't an action—it's an authorial emotion interpretation.

**Scene 3:**
> "Harry Halligan said to a captive audience chuckled along."

This sentence doesn't parse. "Chuckled along" is unclear—who chuckled? The audience? Then it should be: "Harry Halligan said. The audience chuckled."

---

### 4. Scene Opening Failures (Most Critical)

**McDonald Opening Rule Violations:**

**Scene 2 (Clinic Visit):**
> "I need you to sign here, here, and initial here."  
> The receptionist slid the clipboard across the counter.

Opens with dialogue—good! But this feels like the *start* of an interaction, not the *middle*. McDonald openings drop you into conversations already happening. This feels like we arrived exactly on time.

**Scene 4 (Patient List):**
> "—three thousand dollars, Eddie. Jake paid three thousand dollars for him to carry golf clubs."

Good McDonald opening! But you violated the previous scene's opening, which undercuts the rhythm.

**Scene 7 (Driving Range / Winston):**
> "Just hold it lightly. Remember what Doogan said."

Good! But then you immediately describe:
> "Marcus stood behind Brenda at the driving range, hands hovering near her grip."

This is **stage direction**. You're telling us where people are instead of letting dialogue and action reveal it organically.

---

## What King Would Say

If Stephen King were in the room reading Episode 3, here's what he'd tell you:

### "You're Explaining Instead of Trusting"

> "You don't trust your reader. You keep *telling* them what's happening instead of *showing* them and letting them figure it out. When Brenda 'beams,' you're doing the reader's job for them. When you describe the gala as 'a who's who of Southern California Hollywood,' you're not letting the reader *see* the room—you're *telling* them what kind of room it is. Stop helping. Trust the reader to keep up."

### "Your Characters Are Serving the Plot"

> "Mara isn't a person in this episode—she's a *function*. Her job is to be warm, vulnerable, gradually open up. That's not how people work. People are contradictory. They say one thing and do another. They don't have neat emotional arcs across a week. You're bending Mara into the shape the plot needs instead of letting her behavior surprise you."

### "The Golf Tournament Isn't a Situation"

> "What's at stake? Mara plays well, she feels good, endorsements maybe happen. That's not dramatic. That's vague professional success. Where's the *conflict*? Where's the moment when something goes wrong and she has to *choose* something difficult? You've written a week of pleasant interactions instead of a *story*."

### "Cut 10%"

> "This episode would be stronger at 80% of its current length. Every scene has flab—descriptions that don't serve the story, dialogue that repeats information, authorial commentary filling space. Go through every paragraph and ask: 'Does this sentence move the story forward?' If the answer is no, delete it."

## Comparison: Episodes 1 & 2 vs. Episode 3

### Episode 1 — Character-Driven Discovery

- **Scene 1:** Claire dumps Doogan—immediate emotional stakes, witty dialogue masking pain, dessert menu joke revealing deflection
- **Scene 6:** Farmers market meet-cute—Coco as catalyst, Annabelle's Stanford hoodie (specific detail), flirtation through produce discussion
- **Throughout:** Every scene has a *turn*—something changes, information shifts, emotion deepens

**What made it work:**
- Doogan reacting to *situations*, not executing a plan
- Romance unfolding through behavior and specific moments
- Emotional honesty (Claire noticing "hand thing," Annabelle's "you just have one of those faces")

---

### Episode 2 — Escalating Tension

- **Scene 6:** Scavenger hunt—competitive energy, Cheryl skeptical, Jillian following them (external pressure)
- **Scene 14:** Rehearsal dinner—Cheryl vulnerable about Gabby's wedding, Cougar reveal, "Screw your friends. It's perfect" (character voice strong)
- **Throughout:** Investigation building, Martinez closing in, wedding weekend pressure cooking

**What made it work:**
- Situation with *inherent tension* (wedding + investigation + Martinez threat)
- Cheryl as fully realized person with contradictions (competitive, vulnerable, sharp-tongued)
- Physical details grounding emotion (Cougar, ocean drive, clutch on lap)

---

### Episode 3 — Plot-Driven Flatness

- **Scene 1:** Jake pitches Mara job—Eddie/Jake/Doogan talk *about* situation instead of *being in* situation
- **Scene 3:** Gala auction—described from distance, characters as camera subjects, no inherent conflict
- **Scene 12:** Quiet dinner—Mara *explaining* her emotional state instead of *showing* it through behavior

**What's broken:**
- Doogan *doing a job* (low stakes) instead of *in a situation* (high stakes)
- Mara existing to be "helped" rather than being a full person with agency
- Investigation happening off-screen (Abby/Eddie/Baxter scenes) while Doogan plays golf

---

## Recommendations: How to Fix Episode 3

### 1. Create Real Stakes for the Golf Tournament

Right now, it's just a fun charity event. Make something *matter*.

**Possible stakes:**
- Mara's *actually* struggling under pressure (her game is off, not on)
- Rival golfer (Candy?) creates tension beyond just media presence
- Endorsement deal hinges on *this specific event* in concrete way (not vague future possibility)
- Doogan discovers something *at the tournament* that connects to clinic investigation (not just caddying while investigation happens elsewhere)

**King's rule:** Put characters in situations and watch what they do. Right now, Mara doesn't have a *situation*—she has a pleasant week.

---

### 2. Let Mara Be Difficult

She's described as having a "harder edge" post-motherhood. But in the episode, she's... pleasant. A little reserved at first, then warming up.

**More interesting:**
- She's suspicious of Doogan (why is this random guy so good at caddying?)
- She's *actually cold* in interviews (we see it, not hear about it)
- She struggles with guilt about Alex in a way that creates *conflict* (snaps at Doogan, then apologizes)
- Her walls don't come down smoothly—they crack, then go back up, then crack again

**King's rule:** Characters who behave consistently are boring. Real people contradict themselves.

---

### 3. Integrate the Investigation into Doogan's POV

Right now, the clinic investigation happens *to* Doogan (he gets reports via earpiece). He's passive.

**Options to make him active:**
- Nancy shows up at the tournament (volunteer, spectator, something)
- Doogan recognizes someone at the gala from Baxter's patient list
- Martinez appears at the golf course (escalates threat while Doogan's mid-job)
- Mara's *son Alex* connects to the clinic somehow (medications, doctor visits, something concrete)

You need the two plots (rebound job + investigation) to *intersect* in Doogan's experience, not run parallel.

---

### 4. Cut All Authorial Commentary

Go through every scene and delete:
- Emotional interpretations ("beamed," "triumphantly")
- Explanatory clauses ("probably covering someone's shift")
- Psychological stage direction ("Something passed between them")
- Abstract descriptions ("well lubricated," "captive audience")

**King's 10% Rule applies here:**
- Episode 3 current length: ~12 scenes, average 150-200 lines each
- Target cut: 15-20 lines per scene minimum
- Result: Tighter, faster, more trust in reader

---

### 5. Rewrite Every Scene Opening

Apply McDonald Opening Rule ruthlessly:

**Current Scene 2:**
> "I need you to sign here, here, and initial here."  
> The receptionist slid the clipboard across the counter.

**Revised:**
> "—initial here."  
> Abby took the clipboard. Scanned the patient form. Name: Sarah Mitchell. Complaint: lower back pain.

Drop us mid-action, mid-sentence. Cut setup.

**Current Scene 3:**
> "—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen..."  
> [Then immediate description of room, audience, tables]

**Revised:**
> "—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen, I'll see if I can get you an hour driving the ball return cart."  
> Laughter. A man in a tuxedo raised his paddle.  
> "Fifteen! Sold to John Malcolm."  

Cut all description of "captive audience" and "who's who of Southern California." Let the auction happen. Reader figures out it's fancy from behavior (tuxedos, paddles, champagne later).

---

### 6. Give Mara a Secret

Right now, Mara's "secret" (struggling with career/motherhood balance) is *stated explicitly* in Scene 12 dinner conversation.

**More interesting:**
- Doogan *discovers* something about Mara that she's hiding
- She lies about something small, he notices
- Her phone buzzes repeatedly (Alex? Her parents? Someone else?) and she ignores it
- There's a *mystery* about her beyond "reserved but warming up"

**King's belief:** Story is discovery. Right now, Mara is exactly who Jake said she'd be. That's not discovery—that's confirming expectations.

---

## Final Verdict: Where Episode 3 Fails the King Test

### Story Level
- ❌ Plot-driven instead of character-driven
- ❌ No inherent conflict in golf tournament situation
- ❌ Investigation runs parallel to rebound job (doesn't intersect)
- ❌ Mara serves plot function (needs to be "warmed up") instead of being full character

### Prose Level
- ❌ Authorial commentary throughout (emotional interpretations, explanatory clauses)
- ❌ Scene openings frequently violate McDonald rule (setup instead of mid-action)
- ❌ Dialogue becoming expository (characters discussing themes directly)
- ❌ Physical detail declining (less sensory grounding of emotion)

### Technical Level
- ⚠️ Mild adverb presence (could be worse, but needs cutting)
- ⚠️ Some passive voice constructions
- ✅ Dialogue attribution mostly clean ("said" when needed)
- ❌ **Most critical:** Rhythm is wrong—scenes feel like they're starting on time, not mid-stream

---

## What King Would Recommend You Do

1. **Put the manuscript in a drawer for 6 weeks.** (Or at least a week.) Come back with fresh eyes.

2. **Read Episode 1, Scene 1 ("The Dumping") aloud.** Feel that rhythm. That's your voice. That's what works.

3. **Read Episode 3, Scene 3 ("Gala Auction") aloud.** Hear the difference. You're describing instead of dramatizing.

4. **Cut 10%.** Go through every scene, delete authorial commentary, trim setup, trust the reader.

5. **Find the *situation* in the golf tournament.** Right now it's a setting. It needs to be a *pressure cooker*.

6. **Let Mara surprise you.** Stop making her behave the way the plot needs. Let her be difficult, contradictory, *interesting*.

7. **Integrate the investigation.** Doogan can't be passive observer of clinic plot. Needs to intersect his experience at tournament.

---

## Closing Thought

> "The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better." — Stephen King

Episode 3 isn't unsalvageable. The bones are there:
- Doogan meeting Mara (potential chemistry)
- Golf tournament setting (specificity is good)
- Investigation advancing (Nancy emerging as threat)

But right now, you're **manufacturing** the story instead of **discovering** it. You're **telling** instead of **showing**. You're **explaining** instead of **trusting**.

Go back to what made Episodes 1 and 2 work:
- Drop reader mid-action
- Let dialogue do 80% of work
- Physical detail over psychological interpretation
- Characters surprising you (not confirming outline)
- Situations with inherent tension

Trust your instincts. Trust your reader. Cut the flab. Find the conflict.

**The story is there. You just have to excavate it.**

*"Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open."* — Stephen King

You wrote Episode 3 with the door closed. Now it's time to rewrite with the door open—for the reader who deserves your best.
