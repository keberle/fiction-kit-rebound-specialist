Episode 3 Outline — McDonald Style Review
✅ Strong McDonald Elements
Dual-plot structure works: The A-plot (Mara) and B-plot (investigation) running parallel mirrors Fletch's pattern of juggling the main case with personal complications. McDonald often had Fletch dealing with alimony lawyers while investigating murder.

Scene pacing is brisk: 15 scenes for a full episode—this matches McDonald's economy. Scenes are functional, not indulgent.

Off-screen intelligence gathering: The patient visits (Scenes 6, 8) happening while Doogan's busy elsewhere is classic Fletch. Team does legwork, reports via phone. Very McDonald.

Fair-play mystery structure: Clues planted early (Nancy's nails in Scene 2), pattern emerges logically through investigation, readers can solve alongside characters.

Scene endings have hooks: Most scenes end on pivots or tension points rather than resolution—keeps momentum.

⚠️ Structural Concerns
Scene 1 violates McDonald Opening Rule:
Current structure has three people sitting down for a business meeting to discuss the job. This is exactly what McDonald never does. He starts mid-action, mid-conversation—not with setup meetings.

Fix: Open cold with Doogan already at the driving range Tuesday morning, caddying for Mara who's tense and struggling. Jake appears, observes from distance. We learn job details through overheard dialogue and Doogan's behavior, not exposition. The "briefing" happens in fragments throughout the tournament, not in advance.

Scene 3 (Welcome Gala) has passive observation:

"Black-tie gala, speeches about women's empowerment..."
"Doogan positioned in back, watching the auction..."

McDonald never positions his protagonist as an observer at the start of a scene. Fletch is always in it—talking, moving, doing.

Fix: Open mid-auction, Doogan already bidding, already in conflict with another bidder. Establish setting through dialogue and action, not description.

Scene 11 (Quiet Dinner) risks melodrama:

"Sometimes I wonder if I should just stay there. Give up the tour. Be a normal mom."

This is dangerously close to "character announces emotions." McDonald would handle Mara's vulnerability through what she doesn't say, through silences, through behavior rather than confession.

Fix: Show Mara's conflict through actions—she checks her phone compulsively, watches other families, gets quiet when Doogan asks about next season. Doogan observes but doesn't probe. Vulnerability emerges from subtext.

🔍 Missing McDonald Signatures
Minimal dialogue indicators: The outline doesn't specify McDonald's signature dialogue rhythm—rapid-fire exchanges with minimal tags, speaker clarity from rhythm not attribution.

No author invisibility notes: Several scenes describe what characters are thinking or feeling rather than showing behavior. Example: Scene 2 says "Nancy, suspicious" rather than showing suspicious behavior.

POV clarity needed: Some scenes don't specify whose POV we're in, especially the B-plot investigation scenes. McDonald maintains laser focus on POV even when juggling plots.

Flirting feels announced: Scene 5 literally says "(flirting subtly)" in parenthetical. McDonald never flags subtext—it emerges from dialogue rhythm and word choice, never from narration.

🎯 Specific Scene-by-Scene Notes
Scene 2 (Clinic Visit): Solid structure but the phone call afterward is too expository. McDonald would make that conversation punchy, interrupted, with gaps where we fill in Eddie's responses from Abby's reactions.

Scenes 6 & 8 (Patient Visits): These risk becoming procedural. McDonald would handle via dialogue—Eddie calling from Mrs. Yamamoto's house, describing the bunions while it's happening, not after. Real-time comedy beats.

Scene 10 (Martinez Returns Earpiece): Strong confrontation but needs to be pure dialogue. Cut "Doogan tenses," "Martinez examines him," "realizes Martinez has been digging." Show entirely through what they say and don't say.

Scene 14 (Kim's Nails): Good undercover work but risks exposition dump. Make Kim's gossip more naturalistic—interrupted by other customers, fragmented, Abby piecing it together. Show nail work happening throughout (pain, time passing, intimacy of the service).

💡 The Big Fixes
Kill Scene 1 as written. Start Episode 3 with Doogan already caddying on Tuesday morning (current Scene 5). Job details emerge through Jake's nervous presence and Doogan/Mara's interactions. The "why are you doing this job" question reveals itself through behavior.

All video calls should be dialogue-only with speaker behavior shown through word choice, rhythm, timing. No "Baxter appears on screen" or "Eddie looks exhausted." We hear Eddie's exhaustion in how he talks.

Nancy needs to be a character, not a plot device. Scene 2 should give her specific speech patterns, specific behaviors that make her vivid. When she reappears Episode 4, readers should recognize her voice immediately.

Mara's transformation should be behavioral, not stated. Don't write "Mara has smiled more than she has in months." Show her making a joke we haven't heard her make before. Show her initiating conversation instead of responding.

The weather gambit (Scene 13) needs setup. Baxter should mention weather patterns earlier, maybe in a different context. When it pays off, readers feel smart for remembering, not lucky the author mentioned it right when needed.

✨ What This Outline Gets Right
Economy of structure
Fair-play clues
Dual-plot rhythm
Team dynamics through dialogue
Mystery pattern that readers can solve
Stakes present but not inflated
Humor emerges from character (Eddie's bunions) not author trying to be funny
📊 McDonald Alignment Score: 7/10
The structural bones are solid. The episode has the right shape, the right pacing, the right balance. It needs execution discipline—less narration, more dialogue; less explanation, more behavior; less setup, more in media res.

This outline would produce good McDonald-style fiction if written with rigorous dialogue discipline and authorial invisibility. The danger is it could also produce standard mystery prose if the writer fills in too much between the dialogue beats.

Key principle: When you write from this outline, make every scene 80%+ dialogue. When you catch yourself writing "he thought" or "she felt" or "Doogan realized," stop and show it through action or omit it entirely.

The reader should feel like they're eavesdropping on Doogan's week, not reading a report about it.
