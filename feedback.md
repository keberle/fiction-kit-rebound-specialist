# Episode 2: The Wedding Weekend — Stephen King Craft Review

**Review Date:** December 27, 2025  
**Reviewer Perspective:** Stephen King craft principles + Fiction Kit Constitution  
**Episode Scenes:** 17 total (01-holding-cell-graffiti through 17-the-file-that-vanished)

---

## Executive Summary

Episode 2 demonstrates strong structural bones and good momentum. The dual-track narrative (Doogan's wedding job + team investigation) creates natural tension and forward motion. However, the prose needs significant tightening. King's central dictum—"omit needless words"—applies throughout. Many scenes carry 20-30% excess weight that slows the reader and dilutes impact.

**Primary Strengths:**
- Clean POV discipline (no head-hopping)
- Strong dialogue carries scenes effectively
- Sensory detail grounds key moments
- McDonald Rule largely honored (scenes don't repeat prior endings)
- Character voices remain distinct

**Primary Weaknesses:**
- Over-description (atmospheric openings, redundant emotional beats)
- Weak verbs with adverbial crutches
- Explanatory dialogue (characters explaining what reader already knows)
- Pace sags in middle scenes (07-11) where investigation stalls
- Some emotional telling where showing would land harder

---

## Scene-by-Scene Analysis

### Scene 01 — Holding Cell Graffiti

**What Works:**
- Opening line is sharp: "Two hours in a holding cell and Doogan had memorized the graffiti."
- Sensory grounding: ammonia, cold concrete, fluorescent hum
- Martinez/Finch interrogation dialogue is tight and threatening
- Physical exhaustion conveyed through body language (trembling legs, cold metal)

**Needs Tightening:**
- "Sweat. Piss. The ghost of a thousand bad decisions." — This is good, but "ghost of a thousand bad decisions" feels writerly. King would cut it. Just "Sweat. Piss. Fear." lands harder.
- "Finch leaned against the wall, arms crossed." — Standard blocking. Could show his attitude through dialogue instead.
- Several passages explain tension we're already feeling: "The fluorescent lights buzzed. Doogan's exhaustion was catching up..." — The reader knows. Cut.

**Language Issues:**
- "His legs burned. Standing welded his knees together, locked the joints until his thighs trembled with the effort of staying upright." — Two verbs doing the same work ("welded" and "locked"). Pick the stronger one. "Standing locked his knees, thighs trembling."
- "Finch's eyes narrowed" — Standard description. What does it actually look like? What would King notice?

**Pacing:**
Good. The interrogation moves. No throat-clearing.

---

### Scene 02 — The Walkout

**What Works:**
- Finch's opening line (overheard) creates eavesdropper effect
- Hank Stillman's character established efficiently (cheap suit, sweating at 9am)
- Lawyer's transactional tone matches the business reality
- Eddie's loyalty comes through without melodrama

**Needs Tightening:**
- Opening: "Told you he'd lawyer up, I said it the second we walked in..." — Eddie's motormouth is in the right register, but Finch feels wrong here. He doesn't ramble. Cut this and open with the next paragraph.
- "Hank Stillman was a heavyset man in an ill-fitting taupe suit and worn black shoes. He was sweating at 9am..." — Repeats description from two paragraphs earlier. Pick one spot. Kill the other.
- "The station smelled like burned coffee and something industrial." — Generic. King would give us *what* that industrial smell actually is. Disinfectant? Floor wax? Stale piss from the holding cells?

**Language Issues:**
- "Eddie's voice had an edge—not anger, just the sound of someone who'd been woken at three in the morning with terrible news." — Over-explaining. The edge IS the exhaustion and worry. Don't tell us what it means.
- "Doogan leaned against a lamppost. The exhaustion was catching up..." — "Catching up" is weak. "Exhaustion hammered him" or just let him lean and show it physically.

**Dialogue:**
- Hank's voice is pitch-perfect: transactional, blunt, no bedside manner
- Eddie's concern reads genuine

**Structure:**
Scene ends cleanly with pancakes. Good button. Propels to next location.

---

### Scene 03 — Eddie's Kitchen

**What Works:**
- Eddie's opening mid-sentence maintains his motormouth pattern
- Abby's flat greeting ("You look like hell") establishes mood
- Pancakes as comfort/normalcy against crisis works well
- Abby's calm pragmatism balances Eddie's energy
- The "we're family" subtext lands without being stated

**Needs Tightening:**
- Eddie's opening monologue runs 8 lines without interruption. That's too long even for Eddie. Break it with physical action or Abby's interruption.
- "The pancakes were good—light, slightly sweet, the kind of thing that should taste comforting. He barely registered the flavor. His mind was still in that interview room, still hearing Finch's voice." — Cut the first sentence entirely. Just: "He barely tasted them. His mind was still in that interview room." Reader knows why pancakes don't work.
- The earpiece discussion at scene end feels expository. They're explaining technical details the reader doesn't need yet.

**Language Issues:**
- "Eddie pulled himself more coffee" should be "Eddie poured himself more coffee"
- "Abby's green-hazel eyes were steady, concerned but not pitying." — Over-describing. King would cut "concerned but not pitying" and let the eyes do the work.

**Character Voice:**
Eddie's motormouth works but needs variation in paragraph length. Long run-on paragraphs make it hard to track who's speaking.

**Pacing:**
Middle sags slightly when exposition takes over. The scene regains momentum when Baxter calls about the earpiece.

---

### Scene 04 — Doogan's Condo

**What Works:**
- Opening establishes emptiness and Doogan's isolated emotional state
- Shower scene does good physical/emotional work
- Baxter's nervous earnestness comes through
- "Someone had studied him. Learned his patterns. Set him up perfectly." — This lands. Clean. Threatens forward.

**Needs Tightening:**
- "The shower was hot. He stood under it longer than necessary, letting the water run over him, trying to wash away the smell of industrial cleaner and interrogation rooms and exhaustion." — First sentence good. Second sentence does work. Third sentence over-explains. Cut it.
- "This was someone trying to destroy him. / And whoever it was knew exactly how." — Combine these. "Someone was trying to destroy him, and they knew exactly how."
- The entire technical discussion about the earpiece being analyzed by police could be one-third the current length

**Language Issues:**
- "earnest, analytical expression he always had" — Cliché combo. Pick one. "Analytical expression" is enough.
- "worried, analytical" — Don't pair emotions with personality traits. Just show us worried.

**Dialogue:**
Sparse. Effective. Baxter's nervousness shows in his speech patterns ("Just—if he asks...").

**Structure:**
Scene ends on threat: someone watching. Good. But could be punchier. The final paragraph repeats the point three times. Cut to: "And somewhere, that someone was watching."

---

### Scene 05 — Restaurant Meeting

**What Works:**
- Eddie's opening pitch-interrupted establishes energy
- Thomas's correction ("It's Thomas. Not Tom.") reveals character instantly
- Sylvia cutting to "How much?" shows power dynamic
- Parents not revealing full situation creates dramatic irony

**Needs Tightening:**
- "Jewelry caught the restaurant's soft lighting when she moved, deliberate sparkle that said *money*." — "Deliberate sparkle" over-writes. Just: "Jewelry caught the light." We get it.
- "Thomas had the posture of someone who'd bought a lot of things in his life and knew exactly what they cost." — Too much tell. Show us the posture. Let us draw the conclusion.
- The discussion of money/scope runs too long without scene complication

**Language Issues:**
- Multiple instances of "had the [quality] of someone who..." — Lazy construction. King hates this. Show the thing, don't compare it to itself.

**Dialogue:**
Strong throughout. Natural rhythms. Characters interrupt each other properly.

**Pacing:**
Scene could lose 15-20% and be tighter. The back-and-forth about details runs long.

---

### Scene 06 — Country Club Kickoff

**What Works:**
- Terry's opening mid-rant (perfectly in-character)
- Scavenger hunt mechanics are clear and propulsive
- Cheryl's competitive edge emerges naturally through action
- Baxter-in-ear creates nice operational texture
- "I'm not losing to Jillian" establishes stakes beyond winning

**Needs Tightening:**
- "Terry Tamborino stood at the center of controlled chaos, tablet in one hand, phone in the other, talking to three people at once." — Generic description of busy wedding planner. Show us the chaos through his dialogue (which you do), don't describe it first.
- "The patio erupted into movement." — Weak verb. "Teams scattered" or "Chaos."
- Too much description of the country club setting. We don't need "white tablecloths, morning sun, the kind of golf course view..." King would cut this entirely. Start with Terry's voice.

**Language Issues:**
- "She moved with the posture of someone used to being watched." — Again with "posture of someone who..." Show the posture.
- "Competitive. Not playful. Something sharper." — Good instinct but over-explained. Pick one. "Something sharper" is enough.

**Dialogue:**
Terry's voice is fantastic. Theatrical, cutting, efficient. More of this.

**Pacing:**
Once the hunt starts, momentum is excellent.

---

### Scene 07 — Strip Mall Clinic

**What Works:**
- Eddie's motormouth opening monologue perfectly captures his panicked energy
- Martinez's unexpected appearance creates real tension
- The buddy-cop-movie riff is funny and character-appropriate
- "You're on a stakeout." / "I'm thinking about tacos." — Great exchange
- Martinez's warning feels genuine, not just plot mechanics

**Needs Tightening:**
- Opening: Eddie's phone monologue to Baxter runs 10+ lines. Even for Eddie, this needs interruption. Break it with physical action.
- "The strip mall stretched in front of him—faded stucco, hand-painted signs, parking spaces marked with paint so old it was more suggestion than instruction." — Cut entirely. Doesn't do work. King would ax this paragraph.
- Martinez's speech about civilians playing detective runs long. He makes the same point three times. Cut by half.

**Language Issues:**
- "Martinez's voice had an edge now" — Weak description. How does the edge sound? Sharper? Colder? Quieter?
- "That kind of prop that said..." — Again, object describing its own meaning. Show, don't interpret.

**Dialogue:**
Excellent. Rapid-fire, threatening without being melodramatic. Eddie's nervous babbling works.

**Pacing:**
Martinez saves this scene. Without him, it's Eddie sitting on a bench. His arrival at exactly the right moment creates conflict that propels forward.

---

### Scene 08 — The Flower Shop

**What Works:**
- Scavenger hunt mechanics continue to work well
- Jillian as antagonist creates immediate stakes
- "That's so aesthetic" — Perfect influencer voice
- The puzzle-solving (red and white roses) is clean and clever
- Cheryl's backstory (overshadowed younger sister) emerges organically

**Needs Tightening:**
- "The Rose Shop sat between a boutique and a coffee shop, striped awning, window displays full of arrangements." — Generic description. Cut and start with action.
- "The shop smelled like roses and plant water." — Okay, but "plant water" is vague. What does that actually smell like? Green? Mineral? Damp earth?
- Cheryl's explanation of why she hates Jillian runs 4-5 lines. It's good character work, but could be half the length.

**Language Issues:**
- "Jillian's voice carried that practiced enthusiasm that sounded like a product review." — Too much tell. Let us hear it in her dialogue.
- "Not just competitive. Wounded." — End-of-scene summary. Unnecessary. We saw it.

**Dialogue:**
Jillian's influencer-speak is spot-on. Cheryl's sharp responses work.

**Structure:**
Good scene button: heading for bookstore, Jillian following. Propels forward.

---

### Scene 09 — Eddie's House

**What Works:**
- Eddie's panicked monologue to Baxter captures desperation
- Abby's entrance ("Who are you bullying?") shifts tone perfectly
- The IT tech disguise plan is clever and plausible
- Abby's reassurance to Baxter feels genuine and character-appropriate

**Needs Tightening:**
- Eddie's opening monologue runs 15+ lines without pause. Even for motormouth Eddie, this needs breaks.
- The entire "IT guys always look uncomfortable" pep talk could be half as long
- Repetitive reassurance: multiple characters tell Baxter he can do this. Once is enough.

**Language Issues:**
- "Baxter's voice cracked" — Showing fear. Good. But then: "Eddie, I can barely order coffee without looking guilty" — This is telling us the same thing. Pick one.
- "walked closer" / "leaned against" — Generic blocking. King would cut most of this.

**Dialogue:**
Eddie and Abby working together is good. Their voices remain distinct even when they're tag-teaming Baxter.

**Pacing:**
Scene runs long for what it accomplishes (convince Baxter to go to clinic). Could lose 25-30% and be tighter.

---

### Scene 10 — The Speakeasy

**What Works:**
- The speakeasy setting is atmospheric without over-description
- Atticus Finch puzzle solution is clever
- Doogan and Cheryl's banter feels natural
- "You're kind of a nerd" lands as genuine connection moment
- Jillian stuck with champagne while they solve it: satisfying payoff

**Needs Tightening:**
- Opening: Three clues summarized in first line. Good instinct, but the Harper Lee transition feels abrupt.
- "Jazz drifted up—saxophone and piano, scratchy like it came from vinyl." — Okay detail, but do we need it? Does it do work?
- Cheryl's dialogue about enjoying herself runs a bit long. The point is made quickly; the repetition dilutes it.

**Language Issues:**
- "The space opened at the bottom into a bar. Prohibition-era: dark wood, brass fixtures, vintage gin posters." — Listing. King would cut this entirely or reduce to one detail.
- "Her eyes bright" / "Competitive energy still buzzing" — Told, not shown. We can see it in her actions.

**Dialogue:**
- "I'm actually starting to enjoy this" / "Not fun?" / "Exactly. Fun. It's very inconvenient." — Great exchange. Natural, character-revealing, moves the relationship forward.

**Pacing:**
Good momentum. The puzzle-solving keeps things moving. Relationship development doesn't slow the scene.

---

### Scene 11 — Clinic Infiltration

**What Works:**
- Eddie and Abby listening via earpiece creates tension
- Baxter's nervous but successful infiltration is satisfying
- "Nobody told me about that." / "Automated scheduling." — Realistic IT interaction
- Nancy's interruption creates real stakes
- "First field op. Not bad." — Good character moment for Eddie

**Needs Tightening:**
- Opening: "Eddie noticed it when Baxter crossed the parking lot. Another earpiece." — Start with Eddie's reaction, not neutral observation.
- The pre-infiltration discussion in the car runs long. Once Baxter enters the clinic, pace is great.
- Post-escape debrief could be shorter. Point is made quickly.

**Language Issues:**
- "Baxter was pale, breathing hard" — Standard description. What does pale look like on him? Gray? Waxy? Bloodless?
- "She wanted to. I could see it. She was deciding..." — Over-explaining. Just: "She wanted to."

**Dialogue:**
The overheard infiltration works well. Real-time tension. Natural speech patterns.

**Pacing:**
Once Baxter enters, excellent. Before and after, could be tighter.

---

### Scene 12 — Finish Line

**What Works:**
- Terry's opening mid-rant (consistent character voice)
- Jillian's Uber cheat revealed efficiently
- Fat Lady puzzle solution is clever and earned
- Cheryl's shift from anger to acceptance feels natural
- Scene ends with dinner invitation: good forward momentum

**Needs Tightening:**
- "The morning felt like a week ago." — Telling us time has passed. Show it through exhaustion, or don't mention it.
- Prize description (handbag, golf clubs, lighting) unnecessary. The win is what matters.
- Cheryl's reflection on Jillian ("wannabe influencer with fake boyfriend") runs too long for the emotional beat

**Language Issues:**
- "Purpose in every step" — Telling. Show the purpose through action.
- "Terry's eyes gleamed" — Generic description of victory/satisfaction

**Dialogue:**
Terry's voice remains pitch-perfect throughout. "Second prize is public humiliation" is great.

**Structure:**
Good scene end. Sets up rehearsal dinner without explaining too much.

---

### Scene 13 — Debrief and Dead Ends

**What Works:**
- Investigation hits wall: creates tension
- Baxter's explanation of limits is realistic (not movie hacking)
- Team's frustration comes through without melodrama
- Scene efficiently recaps investigation status for reader

**Needs Tightening:**
- Eddie's opening monologue (again) runs too long without break
- Multiple characters explaining the same problem (Sebastian is untraceable, clinic has limits)
- The back-and-forth about the tax records feels repetitive—this ground was covered earlier

**Language Issues:**
- "Baxter's fingers moved across the keyboard" — Generic action. Either cut it or make it specific.
- "Eddie winced" — Weak verb. What does the wince look like?

**Dialogue:**
Information exchange is clear but feels expository. They're telling each other (and reader) what they already know.

**Pacing:**
Scene accomplishes its function (establish dead end) but could be 40% shorter. The point is made multiple times.

---

### Scene 14 — Rehearsal Dinner

**What Works:**
- Cougar as character detail (Cheryl's reaction: "It's perfect")
- Drive along PCH: good atmospheric beat without over-writing
- Cheryl's vulnerability at restaurant (Brad was her boyfriend first) lands hard
- Doogan's quiet support reads genuine
- Sedan in rearview mirror: good tension injection
- Toast scene: Cheryl's speech is pitch-perfect

**Needs Tightening:**
- Restaurant description (venue, lights, water) is generic. Cut most of it.
- Eleanor Whitmore character: sweet but doesn't do much work. Could be cut entirely without loss.
- Pre-dinner conversation at table runs a bit long for what it accomplishes

**Language Issues:**
- "Black dress, simple, elegant. Hair down. Heels that added three inches." — Listing. Pick strongest detail. "Black dress. Hair down." is enough.
- "The house sat in one of Pacific Point's upscale neighborhoods—two stories, perfectly landscaped, the kind of place that whispered money..." — Over-described. King would cut to: "The house whispered money."

**Dialogue:**
Cheryl's rehearsal dinner toast is excellent. Natural voice, addresses elephant in room, emotional without melodrama. This is the scene's highlight.

**Pacing:**
Good momentum. Relationship deepens without stalling plot. Surveillance threat at end propels to next scene.

---

### Scene 15 — One-Way Street Trap

**What Works:**
- One-way street trap is clever and cinematically satisfying
- Martinez reveal is surprising but logical
- Photos of team investigating: real consequence for their actions
- "That's stalking." / "It's surveillance. Different paperwork." — Great exchange
- Martinez's grudging admission ("Things don't add up") creates new tension

**Needs Tightening:**
- Opening: Eddie's voice through earpiece runs long without interruption
- Car chase description is generic. "The sedan changed lanes when he did" — Could be any car chase
- Martinez's "don't play detective" speech makes same point multiple times

**Language Issues:**
- "Average height, compact build, moved with the economy of someone who'd done this before" — Over-described. Pick one detail. "Moved like a cop" is enough—we know what that means.
- "Something that might have been doubt" — Weak. Either it's doubt or it's not. Commit.

**Dialogue:**
Martinez and Doogan's exchange is sharp. Natural antagonism. Good subtext.

**Pacing:**
Trap setup and execution work well. Post-reveal conversation could be shorter.

---

### Scene 16 — Reception

**What Works:**
- Wedding ceremony handled efficiently (doesn't bog down in detail)
- Eleanor Whitmore works better here than at rehearsal dinner
- Cheryl's toast is the scene's emotional center—perfectly executed
- "You're coming with me" / leave early: good character moment
- Relationship arc completes satisfyingly without feeling rushed

**Needs Tightening:**
- Wedding venue description (tents, lights, ocean, flowers, bar) too detailed. Cut 70% of this.
- Dinner courses listing unnecessary. "Dinner came in waves" is enough.
- Multiple descriptions of Cheryl at head table doing nothing. If she's not in scene, don't describe her.

**Language Issues:**
- "Eyes bright" / "Soft. Genuine." — Over-reliance on these character-emotion descriptions
- "That girl's smitten with you" — Eleanor telling us what we can see. Cut this exchange.

**Dialogue:**
Cheryl's toast is gold. Rest of dialogue works but isn't as sharp.

**Pacing:**
Wedding ceremony moves efficiently. Reception drags slightly in middle (dinner courses, dancing description). Ends strong with Cheryl's decision to leave.

---

### Scene 17 — The File That Vanished

**What Works:**
- Real-time file deletion creates genuine tension
- Baxter's helplessness ("I'm just sitting here watching") is effective
- Files vanishing one by one: good visual pacing
- Scene ends on threat: someone covering tracks. Perfect episode cliffhanger.

**Needs Tightening:**
- Opening: Eddie and Abby doing nothing for several paragraphs. Start with Baxter's discovery.
- Explanation of what's in the files could be shorter. The point is they're being deleted, not their full contents.

**Language Issues:**
- "Eddie sprawled across the couch, eyes closed, one arm draped over the back" — Generic blocking. Cut entirely or make it specific to Eddie.
- "The screen cast a blue glow across his face" — Cliché. King would ax it.

**Dialogue:**
Minimal but effective. "It's gone" lands hard because it's simple.

**Pacing:**
Once files start deleting, excellent tension. Before that, scene could start later.

**Structure:**
Perfect episode-end cliffhanger. Creates forward momentum into Episode 3.

---

## Craft-Level Issues (Recurring Patterns)

### 1. ATMOSPHERIC OPENINGS (McDonald Rule Violation)

**Problem:** Multiple scenes open with description before action begins.

**Examples:**
- Scene 06: "Terry Tamborino stood at the center of controlled chaos..."
- Scene 08: "The Rose Shop sat between a boutique and a coffee shop..."
- Scene 14: "The Orchid sat on a cliff in Malibu..."
- Scene 16: "The reception tent smelled like fresh flowers and money..."

**King's Fix:** Start with voice or action. Cut description. Open in media res.

**Recommended Approach:**
- Open with dialogue already in progress (you do this well in some scenes—do it more)
- Open with character mid-action
- When you must set a scene, do it in one sharp detail, then move

**Example Revision:**
❌ "The Rose Shop sat between a boutique and a coffee shop, striped awning, window displays full of arrangements."
✅ [Cut entirely. Start with:] "Half a dozen teams were already clustered around the entrance, arguing over who got to go in first."

---

### 2. WEAK VERBS + ADVERBS

**Problem:** Relying on adverbs to prop up weak verbs instead of choosing strong verbs.

**Examples:**
- "walked slowly" → "drifted" / "crept" / "shuffled"
- "said quietly" → "murmured" / "whispered"
- "looked carefully" → "studied" / "examined"

**King's Rule:** "The road to hell is paved with adverbs." Most can be cut if you choose stronger verbs.

**From Your Text:**
- "Martinez stepped back inside, expression different now" — "Different" + "now" both vague. Show us what the expression actually IS.
- "Terry swept past again" — Good verb! Do more of this.

---

### 3. TELLING EMOTION INSTEAD OF SHOWING

**Problem:** Naming the emotion instead of showing physical/behavioral manifestation.

**Examples:**
- "Baxter was pale, breathing hard" — Good physical showing
- "Cheryl's jaw tightened" — Also good
- "Eddie's voice had an edge" — Telling. What does edge sound like?
- "Something that might have been doubt" — Weak. Commit or cut.

**King's Approach:** Ground emotion in body, voice, action. Never name it directly.

**Recommended Fix:**
Read through and highlight every instance where you name an emotion (frustrated, nervous, worried, doubt, concerned). Replace with physical/behavioral detail or cut entirely.

---

### 4. "THE [X] OF SOMEONE WHO..." CONSTRUCTION

**Problem:** Describing character by comparing them to themselves.

**Examples from your text:**
- "Thomas had the posture of someone who'd bought a lot of things"
- "She moved with the posture of someone used to being watched"
- "moved with the economy of someone who'd done this before"

**Why King Would Cut This:** It's interpretation disguised as observation. Show us the posture. Let reader draw conclusion.

**Fix:**
❌ "Thomas had the posture of someone who'd bought a lot of things."
✅ "Thomas folded his hands on the table. Waited. He'd bought a lot of things in his life."

Or cut entirely: "Thomas folded his hands. 'How much?'"

---

### 5. EXPLANATORY DIALOGUE (Characters Explaining Plot to Each Other)

**Problem:** Characters telling each other things they both already know (for reader's benefit).

**Example:**
Scene 13: Eddie and Baxter explaining to each other that Sebastian is untraceable. Both already know this. It's exposition disguised as dialogue.

**King's Fix:** Characters should speak to advance relationship/scene, not recap plot. If you need to convey information, do it through action or conflict, not explanation.

---

### 6. REPETITIVE EMOTIONAL BEATS

**Problem:** Making the same emotional point multiple times in a scene.

**Example:**
Scene 04 ending: Three different ways of saying "someone's watching and Doogan's in danger." Pick the strongest one. Cut the rest.

**King's Rule:** Make your point once, sharply. Trust the reader. Move on.

---

### 7. PHYSICAL BLOCKING THAT DOESN'T DO WORK

**Problem:** Describing characters moving/sitting/standing when it doesn't reveal character or advance scene.

**Examples:**
- "Eddie walked to the table"
- "Abby sat beside him"
- "Martinez stepped closer"

**When to Keep Blocking:**
- When movement reveals character (nervous pacing, aggressive lean-in)
- When space matters to tension (someone backing away, invading personal space)
- When action interrupts dialogue meaningfully

**When to Cut:**
- Generic movement between dialogue beats
- Staging that exists only to track bodies in space

---

## Language Patterns to Audit

### Search and Destroy List:

1. **"Had the [quality] of"** — Cut 90% of these
2. **"-ly" adverbs** — Cut 50-70% (especially after "said")
3. **"Was/Were" + adjective** — Replace with stronger construction
4. **"That" (relative pronoun)** — Cut half of them
5. **"Seemed / appeared / looked like"** — Commit to what IS, not what seems
6. **"Started to / began to"** — Cut. Just do the action.
7. **"Could see / could hear / could feel"** — POV character IS seeing/hearing/feeling. Cut the filter.

### Example Transformation:

**Before:**
"Doogan could see Martinez was starting to look frustrated. His expression seemed to shift as he began to realize that the story didn't seem to add up."

**After:**
"Martinez's expression shifted. The story didn't add up."

(40 words → 9 words. Same information. Stronger impact.)

---

## POV & McDonald Rule Compliance

### POV Discipline: STRONG ✅

- No head-hopping detected
- Each scene maintains single POV anchor
- Information delivery respects character knowledge boundaries
- Team-earpiece mechanism handles off-screen info cleanly

### McDonald Rule: MOSTLY STRONG ✅

- Scenes generally avoid repeating prior scene's ending information
- Good handoffs between plot threads (Doogan job vs. team investigation)
- **One violation:** Scene 13 opens by restating the investigation dead-end that was the point of prior scenes. Could start with new complication instead.

---

## Character Voice: STRONG ✅

### Eddie's Motormouth Pattern:
Well-executed. Run-on sentences, tangents, steamrolling. **BUT:** Needs more variation in paragraph length. Long blocks of Eddie-speak become hard to track. Break up with action or others interrupting.

### Doogan's Measured Voice:
Good contrast to Eddie. Short responses. Dry delivery. **BUT:** Sometimes TOO interior (explaining his thoughts to us). King would let actions/dialogue do more work.

### Terry's Theatrical Energy:
EXCELLENT. Pitch-perfect. More of this.

### Cheryl's Arc:
Natural progression from competitive to vulnerable to connected. Her dialogue throughout feels real.

### Baxter's Nervous Precision:
Good. Stuttering, hedging, technical jargon. Works.

---

## Sensory Detail: UNEVEN

### What Works:
- Holding cell smell: ammonia, piss, industrial cleaner
- Concrete cold through Doogan's feet
- Cheryl's hair in convertible wind
- Risotto cooking sensory sequence (Episode 1 callback—good)

### What Doesn't:
- Generic descriptions: "fresh flowers," "fresh-cut grass"
- Visual-only scenes (describe what things LOOK like but not smell/sound/texture)
- Filtering through metaphor instead of direct sensation

**King's Approach:** Ground reader in body. Smell, texture, taste, temperature. Not just what things look like.

---

## Pacing & Structure

### Episode Structure: SOLID ✅

**Setup (Scenes 1-5):** Doogan released, lawyer hired, new job accepted, investigation begins
**Rising Action (Scenes 6-11):** Parallel tracks (scavenger hunt + clinic infiltration)
**Complications (Scenes 12-16):** Relationship deepens, surveillance threat, wedding completion
**Cliffhanger (Scene 17):** Files deleted in real-time

Good three-act structure within episode. Plot threads weave effectively.

### Scene Pacing: UNEVEN

**Strong Momentum:**
- Scenes 01, 06, 08, 10, 11, 15, 17

**Sags:**
- Scenes 03, 09, 13 (exposition-heavy, repetitive dialogue)

**Fix:** Cut 20-30% from sagging scenes. Make points once. Move faster.

---

## Dialogue: STRONGEST ELEMENT ✅

Your dialogue consistently carries scenes. Characters sound distinct. Subtext works. Rhythm is natural.

**Best Exchanges:**
- Martinez: "That's stalking." / "It's surveillance. Different paperwork."
- Cheryl: "You're kind of a nerd, you know that?" / "I've been called worse."
- Terry's rants (all of them)

**Where to Improve:**
- Remove explanation dialogue (characters telling each other things they know)
- Cut "said" tags when voice is clear from content
- Trust silence—not every beat needs filling

---

## Recommended Revision Approach

### PHASE 1: Structural Cuts (Target: -20% overall)

1. Open every scene as late as possible
2. Cut atmospheric openings—start with voice/action
3. Remove repetitive beats (making same point multiple times)
4. Tighten Eddie's monologues (break up long paragraphs)
5. Cut middle-sag exposition in Scenes 03, 09, 13

### PHASE 2: Language Tightening (King's 10% Rule)

1. Search for "had the [quality] of someone" — rewrite or cut
2. Remove 50% of adverbs (especially -ly after verbs)
3. Replace weak verbs with strong verbs
4. Cut filter words: seemed, appeared, could see, began to
5. Eliminate "was/were" + adjective where possible

### PHASE 3: Sensory Grounding

1. Add ONE sharp sensory detail per scene (non-visual when possible)
2. Ground emotional beats in body/voice, not named feelings
3. Make settings specific (not generic "fresh flowers"—what KIND?)

### PHASE 4: Dialogue Pass

1. Remove explanation dialogue (characters info-dumping to each other)
2. Cut unnecessary "said" tags
3. Ensure each line advances scene or relationship
4. Add more silence (beats where no one speaks)

## Specific Scene Revision Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY (Biggest Impact):
1. **Scene 13 (Debrief)** — Cut 40%. Repetitive, expository.
2. **Scene 09 (Eddie's House)** — Cut 30%. Pep talk runs too long.
3. **Scene 03 (Eddie's Kitchen)** — Cut 25%. Middle sags into exposition.
4. **Scene 16 (Reception)** — Cut wedding description 70%. Focus on toast and relationship moments.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Good Bones, Needs Tightening):
5. **Scene 02 (Walkout)** — Remove repeated descriptions
6. **Scene 05 (Restaurant)** — Tighten client meeting dialogue
7. **Scene 14 (Rehearsal Dinner)** — Cut generic setting description

### LOW PRIORITY (Already Strong):
8. Scenes 01, 11, 15, 17 — Minimal cuts needed

## Final Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Story structure solid
- Dual-thread plotting works
- Dialogue is consistently strong
- Character voices distinct
- POV discipline excellent

**Primary Issue:**
Language carries 20-30% excess weight. This slows reader, dilutes impact, and makes scenes feel longer than they are.

**King's Prescription:**
"Writing is not life support for bad prose. Cut until it bleeds, then bandage it with strong verbs."

Your story is strong. The bones are good. The work now is sculpture: cutting away everything that isn't the story. Trust your reader. Trust your dialogue. Cut the rest.

Every scene should feel like eavesdropping on a conversation already in progress. You do this well in some scenes (Scene 01, 06, 10). Do it everywhere.

**When in doubt, ask:**
- "Does this sentence do work?"
- "Can I cut this and lose nothing?"
- "Am I explaining what the reader already knows?"

If the answer is no/yes/yes → cut it.

## Recommended Reading

From *On Writing* by Stephen King:
- "Omit needless words" (Strunk & White)
- "The road to hell is paved with adverbs"
- "Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open"
- "Kill your darlings"

**Your Version of This:**
Write fast. Revise ruthless. Trust your reader. Cut 20%.

Then you'll have something lean, muscular, and unputdownable.
