# Stephen King Principles for Fiction

Derived from *On Writing* and observable patterns in King's work.

## 1. Discovery-Driven Writing

**"Story is honorable and trustworthy; plot is shifty."**

### What It Means
- Let characters make decisions based on who they are, not what the plot needs
- Discover the story as you write (even with an outline)
- Every scene should open/close doors naturally

### Application to Fiction Kit
- Characters drive plot, not vice versa
- No plot-convenient coincidences
- Discoveries feel earned through character action

### Example
**❌ Plot-Driven:**
```
Doogan happened to overhear the conversation because he was conveniently in the right place at the right time.
```

**✅ Character-Driven:**
```
Doogan waited outside the courthouse because Martinez always left through the side door. Patience paid off.
```

## 2. Sensory Detail

**"Good description is learned skill, not gift."**

### The Rule
- One specific sensory detail per major scene beat
- Make it unique to THIS moment (not generic)
- Avoid clichés

### Examples

**❌ Generic:**
```
The coffee was hot and bitter.
```

**✅ Specific:**
```
The coffee tasted burnt, like Eddie had left the pot on for three hours. Probably had.
```

**❌ Cliché:**
```
Her eyes were cold as ice.
```

**✅ Unique:**
```
She looked at him like he was a math problem she'd already solved.
```

## 3. Emotional Truth

**"Fiction is the truth inside the lie."**

### What It Means
- Character behavior must be psychologically honest
- Even in genre fiction, emotions must feel real
- Don't let characters do things "because the story needs it"

### Red Flags
- Character suddenly acts out of character
- Emotional reactions feel convenient
- Dialogue doesn't match established voice

### Fix
Ask: "Would this person REALLY do/say this, given what we know about them?"

## 4. Dialogue Drives Pace

**"Dialogue is what characters do to each other."**

### Rules
- Dialogue is action, not just information exchange
- Subtext > text (what's NOT said matters)
- Every line should reveal character or advance plot (ideally both)

### Example

**❌ Information Dump:**
```
"As you know, Bob, we've been partners for five years and you've always been reliable, which is why I'm concerned about this case."
```

**✅ Action/Subtext:**
```
"Five years, Eddie."
"I know."
"Then you know I don't ask twice."
```

## 5. Cut 10-20%

**"Kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler's heart."**

### What to Cut
1. **Adverbs** (especially dialogue tags)
   - ❌ "she said angrily"
   - ✅ "she said" (let dialogue convey anger)

2. **Redundancies**
   - ❌ "He nodded his head in agreement"
   - ✅ "He nodded"

3. **Throat-clearing**
   - ❌ "She started to think about what to say"
   - ✅ Just show her thinking/speaking

4. **Over-explanation**
   - ❌ Explaining what the dialogue already conveyed
   - ✅ Trust the reader

### Process
- First draft: write freely, over-describe
- Second draft: cut 10-20%
- Strengthen verbs instead of adding adverbs

## 6. Show State of Mind Through Action

**"The most important things are the hardest to say."**

### Instead of Telling Emotion
Show through:
- Body language
- Dialogue cadence
- Environmental interaction
- What character notices

### Examples

**❌ Telling:**
```
Doogan was nervous about the meeting.
```

**✅ Showing:**
```
Doogan checked his phone for the third time in two minutes. Still ten minutes early.
```

**❌ Telling:**
```
Eddie was excited to share the news.
```

**✅ Showing:**
```
"So—okay, listen—" Eddie half-stood, sat back down. "You're not gonna believe this."
```

## 7. Honest Motivation

**"Monsters are real, ghosts are real too. They live inside us."**

### Principle
Every character must have clear, believable motivation for their actions—even antagonists.

### Red Flags
- "Because the plot needs it" thinking
- Sudden personality shifts without cause
- Characters acting against self-interest without explanation

### Fix
Ask: "Why would THIS character do THIS thing right now?"

If answer is "so the story can continue," rethink the scene.
