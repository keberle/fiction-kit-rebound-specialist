# McDonald Opening Rule

The McDonald opening rule (attributed to Ross McDonald) requires scenes to open **in medias res** - in the middle of action or dialogue.

## The Rule

Start your scene as if the reader is **eavesdropping** on a conversation or event already in progress.

## Why It Works

1. **Immediate engagement** - Reader is pulled into action instantly
2. **No setup drag** - Avoids slow weather/scene-setting exposition
3. **Trust the reader** - They'll figure out context from dialogue/action
4. **Cinematic** - Mimics how scenes start in film

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Weather/Atmosphere:**
```
The rain pounded against the window. Dark clouds gathered over the city.
```

❌ **Introspection First:**
```
Doogan was tired. The interrogation had drained him.
```

❌ **Scene-Setting:**
```
The coffee shop sat on the corner of Fifth and Main, a small establishment with large windows.
```

❌ **Arrival:**
```
Doogan walked into Eddie's kitchen and sat down at the table.
```

## What TO Do

✅ **Mid-Dialogue:**
```
"—so Hank costs money, obviously, guy's a lawyer even if he's a bottom-tier one—"
```

✅ **Mid-Action:**
```
Doogan caught the glass before it hit the floor.
```

✅ **Eavesdropper Test Passes:**
```
"Did you follow her?"
"What? No. Why would I—"
"Because she just walked out with evidence."
```

## The Eavesdropper Test

**Ask yourself:** If someone started listening to this scene right now, would they understand what's happening without needing a narrator to explain first?

- ✅ YES: Good opening
- ❌ NO: Need to cut earlier and start later

## When to Break This Rule

**Almost never.** If you think you need to break it, you probably don't. Start later in the scene.

**Rare exception:** A single-sentence opening action before dialogue, IF it's critical setup:

```markdown
The phone rang at 3 AM.
"Martinez," Doogan said.
```

But even this could be improved:
```markdown
"Martinez," Doogan said into the phone. Three in the morning.
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: "Just a little setup"
```
It had been three days since the interrogation. Doogan needed answers.

"Eddie, we have to—"
```

**Fix:** Cut the setup. Start with dialogue.

### Mistake 2: "Reader needs context"
```
The farmer's market buzzed with Sunday morning shoppers. Doogan scanned the crowd for Abby.

"Over here!" she called.
```

**Fix:** Trust the reader. They'll get context from dialogue.
```
"Over here!" Abby waved from the produce stand.
```

### Mistake 3: "This is important mood"
```
The interrogation room was cold and sterile, designed to make suspects uncomfortable.

"Where were you Friday night?" Martinez asked.
```

**Fix:** Weave mood into action/dialogue.
```
"Where were you Friday night?" Martinez leaned back in the metal chair, the cold fluorescent light washing him out.
```

## Practice Exercise

Take any scene opening with setup/atmosphere/introspection and cut the first paragraph. Start with the second paragraph. Does it work better? Usually yes.
