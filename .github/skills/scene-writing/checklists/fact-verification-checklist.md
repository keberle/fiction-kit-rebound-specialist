# Fact Verification Checklist

Quick reference for preventing factual contradictions in scene writing.

---

## PRE-WRITING (MANDATORY)

### Identify References
- [ ] Reviewed outline for Scene N
- [ ] Identified what prior events will be mentioned
- [ ] Listed all "you said" / "we discussed" moments
- [ ] Noted any amounts, times, or specific details to reference

### Create Fact Reference Table

For each reference:
- [ ] Source scene identified (Scene X, lines Y-Z)
- [ ] Exact quote or detail extracted
- [ ] Constraint documented (what NOT to contradict)
- [ ] Table kept visible during writing

---

## DURING WRITING (CONTINUOUS)

### Before Writing Reference Phrases

When writing these phrases, STOP and verify:

**Direct references:**
- [ ] "like we discussed" - verified source?
- [ ] "like you said" - found exact quote?
- [ ] "you told me" - located prior dialogue?
- [ ] "we agreed" - confirmed agreement exists?
- [ ] "last time" - verified prior occurrence?
- [ ] "earlier" - checked timeline?

**Comparative statements:**
- [ ] "more than expected" - verified baseline?
- [ ] "less than we thought" - confirmed prior expectation?
- [ ] "different from" - located comparison source?
- [ ] "not what we planned" - verified plan exists?

**Factual claims:**
- [ ] Specific amounts - matched to source?
- [ ] Specific times - verified timeline?
- [ ] Specific locations - confirmed prior mention?
- [ ] Attributed quotes - read actual dialogue?

---

## POST-WRITING (MANDATORY)

### Search Scene for References

- [ ] Searched for "you said"
- [ ] Searched for "we discussed"
- [ ] Searched for "like we talked about"
- [ ] Searched for "earlier"
- [ ] Searched for "last time"
- [ ] Searched for "remember"
- [ ] Searched for "you mentioned"
- [ ] Searched for comparative phrases ("more than," "less than")

### Verify Each Found Reference

For each reference:
- [ ] Prior event identified
- [ ] Source scene located
- [ ] Exact lines read (not from memory)
- [ ] Reference matches established detail
- [ ] If mismatch: documented for revision

---

## VIOLATION DOCUMENTATION

If contradictions found:

```markdown
**Line [X]:** "[quote from scene]"
- References: Scene Y, lines Z
- Established: [actual fact]
- Problem: [contradiction]
- Fix: [corrected version]
```

- [ ] All violations documented
- [ ] All fixes implemented
- [ ] Re-ran audit until zero violations

---

## QUICK VALIDATION

Before marking scene complete, verify:

1. [ ] Zero references to prior events, OR
2. [ ] All references verified against source scenes
3. [ ] Fact Reference Table created and used
4. [ ] Post-writing audit completed
5. [ ] No violations remaining

---

## RED FLAGS

If any of these appear WITHOUT verification:
- ⚠️ Character states amount/time/place from prior scene
- ⚠️ Character quotes or paraphrases prior dialogue
- ⚠️ Narrative references prior events
- ⚠️ Comparative statements about expectations
- ⚠️ "You said" or "we discussed" phrases

**STOP. VERIFY. PROCEED.**

---

## When This Is Required

✅ **ALWAYS** when:
- Scene N > 1 in episode
- Characters reference prior conversations
- Dialogue includes comparative statements
- Narrative mentions prior events

❌ **SKIP** only when:
- Scene 1 of Episode 1 (nothing to reference)
- Scene has zero references to prior events
- All dialogue is about present moment

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **"Sounds right" syndrome** - Dialogue sounds natural but contradicts facts
2. **Memory substitution** - Remembering what "probably" happened vs. what actually did
3. **Emotional projection** - Attributing feelings to prior scenes without verification
4. **Precision inflation** - Adding specific times/amounts not in source
5. **Comparative assumptions** - "More than" without verifying baseline

---

## Goal

**Every reference to prior events matches established facts.**

Zero tolerance for factual contradictions.
