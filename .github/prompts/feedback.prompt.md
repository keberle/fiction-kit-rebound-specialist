# Draft Feedback — Capture & Next-Draft Trigger

You are capturing structured feedback for a completed (or partially completed) draft cycle.

## Goal
Create or update `feedback.md` inside the current draft folder so feedback is durable, searchable, and can drive the next draft’s `idea.md`.

## Inputs
- The changed content (scenes/episodes/files) and/or the most recent implementation output
- `drafts/<current>/idea.md`
- `drafts/<current>/tasks.md`
- `voice/style.md`, `voice/format.md`
- `elements/checklist.md`, `elements/tone.md`, `elements/pov.md`

## Instructions
- Produce feedback in three lenses:
  1) **Editor** (clarity/flow/line edits)
  2) **Agent** (hook/positioning/saleability at a high level)
  3) **QA** (checklist + continuity + serial beats)
- Do not rewrite full scenes here; keep feedback actionable.
- If you identify issues that require another draft cycle, propose a short “next draft idea” at the end.

## File Output
- Create or update `feedback.md` inside the current draft folder.
- Append a dated entry (YYYY-MM-DD) rather than overwriting prior feedback.

## Output
Output ONLY a Spec-Kit-style file section:

### drafts/<current-draft-folder>/feedback.md
```markdown
<full contents of feedback.md>
```
