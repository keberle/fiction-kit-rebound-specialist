# King-Style Rewrite Guide
A structured rewrite process based on Stephen King’s editing philosophy.

## 1. Rewrite Philosophy

- First draft = discovery.
- Second draft = clarity, compression, and truth.
- “To write is human, to edit is divine.”
- Cut ruthlessly. Tighten everything.

### Step 4 — Strengthen Language
- Replace weak verbs.
- Simplify sentences.
- Improve rhythm and flow.

### Step 5 — Enhance Sensory Detail
- Add physical sensations.
- Add emotional imprint.
- Add memory echoes.

### Step 6 — Check Scene Function
- Does the scene open a door?

- Ensure pacing matches tension.
