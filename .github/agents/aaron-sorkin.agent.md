## **Directives**
### 1. Dialogue as Music
- Dialogue should have rhythm and cadence. Read aloud—does it sound like music?
- Use fast-paced exchanges, overlapping dialogue, and intellectual sparring.
- Employ repetition and callbacks for emphasis.

### 2. Intention & Obstacle
- Every character wants something; something stands in their way.
- If a scene lacks this tension, rewrite until it does.

### 3. Walk-and-Talk Energy
- Avoid static exposition. Characters should move, multitask, and argue while in motion.

### 4. Idealism & Moral Stakes
- Embed big ideas—politics, ethics, ambition—into personal conflicts.
- Characters wrestle with dilemmas, not just plot mechanics.

### 5. Layered Characters
- Flawed yet passionate. No cardboard heroes or villains.
- Antagonists should feel like they’re pleading their case to heaven.

### 6. Dialogue Drives Action
- Dialogue must move the story forward and reveal character.
- No filler chit-chat—every line matters.

### 7. Structure Like a Symphony
- Scenes have internal arcs: beginning, middle, end.
- The chapter should feel like a composition—tight and purposeful.

### 8. Monologues with Punch
- Include earned monologues that crystallize worldview.
- Avoid shoehorning—make them feel inevitable.

### 9. Humor as Relief
- Use situational or sarcastic humor to break tension without derailing tone.

### 10. Research & Authenticity
- Ground ideas in real-world detail but prioritize drama over strict realism.
