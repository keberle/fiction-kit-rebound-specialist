## Scene 14 — Tournament Finale

"She's not making content now, is she?" Mara said.

"No, she's trying to play golf, possibly for the first time this year."

In her brief pro career, she had made it to the U.S. Women's Open but it was as much of a fluke as anything and the number of followers she picked up there was the only real payoff she cared about.

"I hate this hole." Mara took the driver from Doogan's outstretched hand.

"Yeah, I'm not sure who thought an uphill fairway with a plateau in the middle was a good idea but here we are."

"Hit the plateau and you're golden." Eddies's voice came on in Doogan's ear.

"But—" Doogan replied just barely loud enough to be picked up by the earpiece.

"—come in a little short and without a bunch of back spin and it won't stick, letting the ball roll backwards. Which makes—" Eddie continued.

"Kind of a make or break drive." Doogan said out loud this time.

"Yeah." Mara said, a little in her head.

"So just make the plateau."

"Its two-sixty to the flat part and the uphill will steal distance." Mara said looking down the fairway.

"So hit it two-seventy" Doogan said, handing her a tee.

"Right."

"Effort—"

"—you know that's a gimmick, right? Its a word to say to take you out of your brain for a minute."

"Humor me."

Because Candy had turned in a card before Mara the day before, even though they were tied, Mara had to tee off first.

"Here we go." Mara said, setting the tee and ball and stepping back to look at the course before approaching and settling into her stance.

"Don't come up short." Candy said, quietly but not quietly enough. Tilly and her cohort of influencers giggled and were "shushed" by the tournament officials.

Mara breathed in deep through her nose, paused and then wound back slow and smooth, found the apex, paused and mouthed the word "Effortless" before unwinding in one clean motion. The ball arced high and landed on the front side of the plateau, settling to a stop.

A few moments later and Doogan's earpiece erupted "Oh my God! We just saw it on the live stream. That was beautiful!"

"I think your skirt is the only thing coming up short so far but the tee box is yours." Mara said quietly to Candy on her way back to Doogan and her bag.

Candy was feeling the pressure. She looked side eyed at Mara but didn't say a word. Here shot off the tee was solid but it also faded just a bit to the right side of the course where the plateau hadn't started, leaving her ball landing in an uphill spot where it paused before rolling back and even more to the right, stranding itself in the rough.

"That's my girl!" Tilly called out.

Candy shot her a death stare and mouthed something like "moron" before returning her driver to her caddy.

Mara and Doogan headed to the plateau and her approach shot while a larger group of media and Tilly's influencers all walked along the right side of the course, stalking Candy who was suddenly a lot less charismatic.

"Think she'll get out of it?" Mara said stretching and reaching for the seven iron in Doogan's hand.

"I am pretty sure she usually edits out slices like that from her instagram videos so it might be a crap shoot."

Candy had held it together on the front nine. She'd get a birdie, next hole Mara would catch her again. Back and forth, all day. This was Candy's first experience in the grind of the final day of tournament play in the stop seed, even if this was just an exhibition tournament.

Her caddy handed her an iron and she clenched it in her grip before stepping up to her ball with a very intense look and with one rip through the air, her ball flew high and on line, landing on the close side just outside of the collar of the green.

"She'll have to chip on from there."

Mara was already in place, took a breath, quiet and calm.  The ball flew high, tons of spin found the green, nine feet from the flag and sat dead still.

"Wow!"

"Wow, indeed. She stuck that one right on target." Eddies's voice in his ear.

"Thank you," she smiled handing her iron to Doogan as if she had done that a thousand times.

Candy managed to chip on to the green, on the opposite side of the hole from Mara about 4 feed out.  Both sunk their putts, giving Mara the one stroke advantage with her birdie.

"The only hole worse than seventeen—"

"—is eighteen," Doogan finished the thought, handing Mara her driver.

"Yeah."

The eighteenth hole was clearly inspired by courses like Sawgrass, with an extreme dog leg left, wrapping around a huge stand of pine trees.

"She can either bomb it over the trees or lay up on the dog leg." Eddie chimed in.

"She crushed that last one." Doogan replied quietly.

"Yeah but she didn't have much height on that one."

"Hey! Baxter," Doogan put his finger over the earpiece to improve the audio a bit.

"Yeah, Doogan?"

"I'm seeing some weather. What's going on?"

"Yeah, a high pressure system has blown in. Happens in that area of the coast."

"I see where you're going with this. The open, maybe ten years ago?" Eddie chimed in.

"Exactly. It impacted the loft on a bunch of shots."

"But won't Candy know that too?" Baxter asked.

"No. She lives in Arizona, trains there too." Eddie added.

"And there's almost no pressure systems like that there." Baxter was finally catching up.

"Yep."

"Lay up." Doogan handded the three wood to Mara who looked confused.

"Lay up? Really?"

"Trust me. Lay up."

"But there's no way that Candy is going to—"

"—let's hope so."

Mara approached the teebox, set the tee and ball in place and stepped back for the shot.

"Chicken shit." Candy said under her breath after noticing the club selection.

Mara shot a glance back to Doogan who mouthed "trust me" to her back.

Mara hit a beautiful drive towards the back end of the dog leg, leaving a mid length approach to the green.

"You better be right or I just sold out." she said to Doogan.

Candy approached the tee box, put down the tee and ball and started to line up for the dog leg to the right before looking directly back at Mara and then the media, smiling and shifting to the tree side.

Doogan could feel the air, the pressure system.

Candy smiled before winding up and crushing the ball off the tee.  It hung in the air longer than she expected, moved slightly with the changing course of the air before falling, well short of the clearing and buried amongst the back side of the pine trees.

"Mother f—" she said before containing herself.

"She's stealing Brenda's line now." Mara said, handing Doogan the three wood.

Since the edge of the trees where Candy found her ball were not in the penalty area, the officials declined to let her take a drop. Candy hadn't hit out of the pine needles much before. It was definitely not Instagram-worthy—an avalanche of strokes and profanity.

Mara hit a beautiful approach shot on to the green and drained a twelve foot putt to win the pro exhibition.

Jake was introducing her to a number of important looking people and there was lots of posing for selfies and autographs taking place. Brenda showed up with Marcus and they both bounced and screamed when Mara finally got over to them.

"Two meetings today and another one with shoe company tomorrow," Jake said, coming up to Doogan who still had Mara's golf bag on his shoulder. "Tell Eddie that I'll wire the money as soon as I'm back in my room."

"Pleasure doing business with you, Jake."

"You were right. You are a professional." he shook hands with Doogan before heading back to the business people he had been showing around.

It was a good fifteen minutes before Mara made it back to Doogan.

"You were right." she said walking to him.

"I got lucky."

"I think it was me that got lucky."

"Nah, the way you play is definitely not luck."

"I don't mean my playing."

"Ah."

"I like you Doogan.  I like you a lot."

"But—"

"—my life is complicated. If it wasn't for the meeting tomorrow morning, I'd already be on a flight back to Maui."

"You're a good mom, Mara."

"I don't always feel like it but thank you."

"This has been a fun week. Well worth the donation."

Mara laughed. "I will miss you, Doogan. You were a lot more than some donor from a charity auction."

"Thank you for that. I'll drop the clubs off at the clubhouse and let Jake know."

"Take care of yourself."

"You too and remember—"

"—effortless."

"Right."
