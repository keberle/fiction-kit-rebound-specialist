## Scene 11 — Tournament Standings

"—absolutely. Brenda kept me laughing all day."

Mara was surrounded by a cluster of reporters near the eighteenth green. Doogan stood off to the side with Winston.

"Ms. Palani, you're tied for first despite the two-stroke penalty on four. How did you recover?"

"Honestly, I think we were having too much fun to even notice."

Laughter rippled through the reporters. One of them called out to Brenda.

"Ms. Atwood, how does it feel to be tied for the lead?"

"Terrifying?" Brenda grinned. "I've never been tied for first in anything before. I think I was first in my sixth grade class to get my period but they don't really give you an award for that."

"Winston, I can't thank you enough," Doogan reached his hand out to shake Winston's.

"Doogan, it was my privilege. Besides, this has been so much fun for me."

"I'm sorry your wife didn't get to meet Brenda."

"Doogan, she's been dead for seven years."

"Oh, I'm—"

"Don't be. I just pretend she's still around so people aren't uncomfortable that an old guy like me lives alone. This week has been one of the best that I've had since I lost her and every night I do tell her about my day, even if she can't hear me."

"She hears you."

"Thank you. And if you're ever looking to grab a quick nine, you know where to find me."

"I will definitely take you up on that. You're not going to say 'goodbye' to Brenda and Mara."

He looked back over at the media frenzy taking place. "Always leave 'em wanting more, Doogan."

"Good advice."

"I am meeting with a shoe company tomorrow and a sportswear company tonight. I have to admit—"

"Don't go getting all mushy on me now, Jake." Doogan didn't take his eye off Mara to respond to her manager who had appeared to his left.

"If she can win tomorrow—"

"Yeah, I know. Everyone loves a—"

"—winner. So whatever you're doing, keep it up."

"Yeah."

Jake patted Doogan on the shoulder before disappearing into the crowd.

"Still here?" Mara was walking towards him.

"I wouldn't miss this."

"What happened to Winston?"

"I am not sure he was feeling TikTok worthy."

"Brenda will be crushed."

"Winston is easy to find. I'll let her know where."

"She'll appreciate that. Even the press were asking about him. He's quite the character."

"Yes, he is."

"So I was wondering—"

"—I'm not going on tour with you."

Mara laughed. "How about dinner?"

"Where did Brenda pull influence and get us into this time? That place last time could have doubled as the White House press briefing room. I've never seen so many cameras."

"I was thinking something a little less TMZ this time."

"Oh?" she had Doogan's attention now.

"Some place quiet. Just us?"

"You said the magic words."

"Pick me up? Seven?"

"Perfect."

From the clubhouse, surrounded by celebrity journalists, he could make out Candy giving them the side eye. Might as well enjoy a quiet evening. Tomorrow would be war.
