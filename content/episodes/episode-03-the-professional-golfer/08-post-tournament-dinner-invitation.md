## Scene 8 — Post-Tournament

"—perfectly healthy. Her doctor confirmed it, says the prescriptions don't make sense—"

Doogan pressed his finger to his ear, turned away from the eighteenth green. Eddie's voice through the earpiece. In the distance, Brenda and Mara were holding court with a captive group.

"It was a good day. And yes, fun. More fun than I expected. But we have another day tomorrow so we need to stay focused." Mara said, media hanging on every word.

"Then why prescribe them?"

"That's the question. And she's loaded—five car dealerships—so it's not money."

"Doesn't add up."

"I owe it all to my amazing caddy, Winston." Brenda gushed.

Winston shook his head.

"Abby find anything?"

"Hang on—"

Abby's voice replaced Eddie's.

"Two interviews. Deceased woman, three months ago. Pancreatic cancer. Dying man, liver failure, maybe weeks left. Both of them, minimal records at the clinic."

"So healthy people over-prescribed, dying people under-documented."

"Right. What's the connection?"

Jake stood near the media, watching Mara and Brenda, smiling with approval.

Doogan nodded. "What's next."

"Baxter's going in tonight."

"Baxter? Why?"

"The patient files don't add up and we need to see inside that exam room."

"She's coming my way. I need to go."

"Good luck."

The earpiece went silent.

"You missed the photo op," Mara said.

"I have a feeling I can see it on social media in a few moments."

Mara glanced back to see Marcus not missing a moment. "Good point."

"You had a good day."

"I did. Thank you for that."

"I just carried your clubs."

"Uh huh. So...um...Brenda pulled some strings and got us a table at some trendy LA spot...Nobu...or something. But I'm not looking forward to navigating LA traffic so I was thinking..."

"You'd like a ride? You know we have Uber and Lyft here, right?"

"I've heard but how can I be sure that the driver will know all of my favorite movie quotes."

"I think your odds are better than you think this close to Hollywood but I'd love to pick you up."

"Do you think Winston would—"

"I'm sure he's heading home already."

Winston headed to the parking lot.

"7am tomorrow? We're the second group."

Winston nodded.

"Heading home to his wife?"

"With a whole day of new stories to share with her, I'm sure."

"I think we all want our 'Winston' to come home to us."

"Preferably with stories?"

"Exactly. I better go rescue Brenda from the reporters. Seven o'clock?"

A familiar sedan sat in the parking lot.

"Uh...right. Seven."

Mara headed back.

Doogan tapped his right ear. "Baxter?"

"Yeah, what's up?"

"I have company."

"Company?"

"Martinez is here."

"But how did he—"

"Doesn't matter." Doogan headed to his car.

"Mr. Andrews. Pick up a side job?"

Doogan glanced down at the caddy's vest.

"Well, I have to pay my lawyer's fees somehow, don't I?"

"Yeah, he's a real piece of work. But with a condo like yours I'm guessing you can afford him."

"My modest place?"

"Please. On my salary, I'd be lucky to pay for a parking spot in your building."

"Being a caddy at a fancy Pro Am must pay better than I realized."

"I can put in a good word for you."

"Maybe when I solve this case. I hate to leave loose ends. Speaking of loose ends—" Martinez produced a zip-lock evidence bag from his jacket pocket. The earpiece.

"Pick up a new gadget?"

"What is it? The earpiece?" Baxter blurted out into Doogan's earpiece.

"Your lawyer, Mr. Stillman filed a phonebook of paperwork with the department to get this back. Not exactly Radio Shack, is it?"

"What is Radio Shack?" Baxter asked.

"Oh, yeah...it does look familiar."

"The IT guys at the station can't seem to match it to anything. Not familiar parts, can't be monitored, even with our search warrant."

"You have a search warrant?"

"You've watched enough police shows to know the answer to that, Mr. Andrews."

Doogan said nothing.

Martinez looked into Doogan's ears. "Uh huh. Hello, Mr. Baxter."

"Oh no!"

Doogan smiled. "I appreciate you coming all this way to return my property to me, Detective Martinez. How is the investigation going?"

"It's a strange one for sure. Can't seem to find anyone who wanted Ms. Anders dead. The clinic is odd but nothing indicating murder. And then there's you—"

"Me?"

"Somehow involved, difficult to get any real background on and your job as a consultant never seems to take you anywhere near an office building. Come on, Mr. Andrews. Surely you recognize that as long as you're a question mark, I have to keep asking."

Doogan said nothing.

"I'll be in touch, Mr. Andrews. Enjoy the tournament."

"I googled it. Was Radio Shack really a thing?"

"Not now, Baxter."
