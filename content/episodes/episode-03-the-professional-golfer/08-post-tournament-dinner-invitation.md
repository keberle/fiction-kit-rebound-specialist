## Scene 8 — Post-Tournament

"—perfectly healthy. Her doctor confirmed it, says the prescriptions don't make sense—"

Doogan pressed his finger to his ear, turned away from the eighteenth green. Eddie's voice through the earpiece. In the distance, Brenda and Mara were holding court with a captive group of the media hanging on every word.

"It was a good day. And yes, fun. More fun than I expected." he could hear Mara saying to the press. "But we have another day tomorrow so we need to stay focused."

"Then why prescribe them?"

"That's the question. And she's loaded—five dealerships—so it's not money."

"Doesn't add up."

"I owe it all to my amazing caddy, Winston" Brenda beamed and gestured to Winston to join her.

Winston shook his head, embarrassed.

"Abby find anything?"

"Hang on—"

Abby's voice replaced Eddie's.

"Two interviews. Deceased woman, three months ago. Pancreatic cancer. Dying man, liver failure, maybe weeks left. Both of them, minimal records at the clinic."

"So healthy people over-prescribed, dying people under-documented."

"Right. What's the connection?"

Jake stood off towards the edge of the media, smiling triumphantly before looking over at Doogan and mouthing "thank you".

Doogan nodded.  "What's next."

"Baxter's going in tonight."

"Baxter? Why?"

"The patient files don't add up and we need to see inside that exam room," Abby responded.

"She's coming my way. I need to go."

"Good luck."

The earpiece went silent.

"You missed the photo op," Mara said.

"I have a feeling I can see it on social media in a few moments."

Mara glanced back to see Marcus not missing a moment. "Good point."

"You had a good day."

"I did. Thank you for that."

"I just carried your clubs."

"Uh huh. So...um...Brenda pulled some strings and got us a table at some trendy LA spot...Nobu...or something. But I'm not looking forward to navigating LA traffic so I was thinking..."

"You'd like a ride? You know we have uber and lyft here, right?"

"I've heard but how can I be sure that the driver will know all of my favorite movie quotes."

"I think your odds are better than you think this close to Hollywood but I'd love to pick you up."

"Do you think Winston would—"

"I'm sure he's heading home already." Doogan said as he waved to Winston, already heading to the parking lot. Winston looked back and Doogan.

"7am tomorrow?  We're the second group."

Winston nodded back.

"Heading home to his wife?" Mara asked Doogan.

"With a whole day of new stories to share with her, I'm sure."

"I think we all want our 'Winston' to come home to us."

"Preferably with stories?"

"Exactly. I better go rescue Brenda from the reporters. Seven o'clock?"

Doogan noticed a familiar sedan in the parking lot. "Uh...right. Seven," he smiled back to Mara.

Mara headed back to the enclave of paparazzi, still looking for soundbytes.

Doogan tapped his right ear. "Baxter?"

"Yeah, what's up?"

"I have company."

"Company?"

"Martinez is here?"

"But how did he—"

"Doesn't matter." Doogan took a deep breath before heading to his car, which coincidentally was parked next to the detective's sedan.

"Mr. Andrews. Pick up a side job?"

Doogan glanced down, remembered he was still wearing the caddy's vest.

"Well, I have to pay my lawyer's fees somehow, don't I?"

"Yeah, he's a real piece of work. But with a condo like yours I'm guessing you can afford him."

"My modest place?"

"Please. On my salary, I'd be lucking to pay for a parking spot in your building."

"Being a caddy at a fancy Pro Am must pay better than I realized."

"I can put in a good word for you."

"Maybe when I solve this case. I hate to leave loose ends. Speaking of loose ends—" he held produced a zip loc evidence bag from his inside jacket pocket and relased half of his fingers letting the bag unroll.  It was the earpiece they'd taken from him when he was booked.

"Pick up a new gadget?"

"What is it? The earpiece" Baxter asked in Doogan's earpiece.

"Your lawyer, Mr. Stillman filed a phonebook of paperwork with the department to get this back. Not exactly Radio Shack, is it?"

"What is Radio Shack?" Baxter asked.

"Oh, yeah...it does look familar."

"The IT guys at the station can't seem to match it to anything. Not familiar parts, can't be monitored, even with our search warrant."

"You have a search warrant?"

"You've watched enough police shows to know the answer to that, Mr. Andrews."

Doogan was immediately grateful that Baxter had insisted they use an encrypted system for making calls to each other.

Martinez craned his neck to the side, looking into Doogan's ears. "Uh huh. Hello, Mr. Baxter."

"Oh no!"

Doogan just smiled. "I appreciate you coming all this way to return my property to me, Detective Martinez. How is the investigation going?" Doogan asked innocently, reaching for the evidence bag.

"Its a strange one for sure. Can't seem to find anyone who wanted Ms. Anders dead. The clinic is odd but nothing indicating murder. And then there's you—"

"Me?"

"Somehow involved, difficult to get any real background on and your job as a consultant never seems to take you anywhere near an office building. Come on, Mr. Andrews. Surely you recognize that as long as you're a question mark, I have to keep asking."

Doogan took a deep breath. He'd give him some explanation if he didn't think it would just incriminate him further. "I'm an open book, Detective." He opened the trunk of the cougar and folded the caddy vest and the evidence bag with the earpiece into the duffle bag in in the trunk.

"I googled it. Was Radio Shack really a thing?"

"Not now, Baxter."
