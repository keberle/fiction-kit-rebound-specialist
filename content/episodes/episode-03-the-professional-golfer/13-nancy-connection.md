## Scene 13 — Nancy Connection

Two minutes into the elevator ride and Doogan's phone buzzed.  Eddie.

"Strike out, slugger."

"How do you know these things?"

"Baxter said the earpieces have GPS. So even when you shut off the mic—"

"—you're still stalking me. Got it."

"So you got her to her door like a gentleman, just leave it at that, Doogan." Abby's voice came over the earpiece.

"Thanks, Abby."

"You never told us how the tournament went so we had to check the news. They're tied for first with Reality Barbie and Golf Buns?" Eddie broke in.

"Yeah, they played great."

"How did you get the actress to play well enough in the scramble?"

"I called an old friend."

"Anyone I know?"

"Oh yeah, Winston."

"Winston? WINSTON?!?!? That old hustler. Is he still hustling muni tracks in Reseda?"

"Yeah, I found him hustling a nine holer and offered five hundred bucks to caddy for the actress."

"Eh, he's an old hustler but a good guy."

"Did you know his wife died?"

"I didn't know he was married—oh, no—I did know that. Francis or something like that. Yeah, very sad. Look, speaking of dead people—"

"Great segue, Eddie." Abby cut in.

"—so the patients who keep dying all see this one nurse."

"Nancy?"

"Right. Nurse Nancy. The angel of death. And they see her in this one exam room with not cameras."

"Right. Exam room one or something like that."

"Exactly. And its loaded with palliative care devices, respirators, morphine buttons and crazy stuff like that."

"Tha's not illegal though." Doogan approached his car in the basement parking garage.

"Yeah, I think we're still not seeing the whole picture. But we are thinking we need to look into Nurse Nancy a bit more."

"The woman you just described as the 'angel of death'?"

"Exactly. But Baxter is coming up empty on the cyber stalking."

"What else do we know about her?" Doogan said, pulling on the main road and heading for the freeway.

"She's had tons of work done." Abby chimed in.

"What is tons?" Doogan turned on to the freeway.

"She's like one botox injection from 'muppet status'." Abby replied.

"Ew."

"Right. But there are like a hundred plastic surgery places in LA so that won't help us."

"She has expensive nails." Abby added.

"Nails. Nails..."

"Developing a new fetish, Eddie?"

"No, why is the nails thing ringing a bell?"

"No clue."

"Got it. The stakeout attempt. There's a nail place down at the opposite end from that clinic in the same strip mall."

"Seems a little convenient."

"Not really." Abby said.

"LA traffic can make you get creative and some businesses will give discount to people working in the neighboring places so yeah...maybe."

"But how much could a nail tech know?"

"Depends."

"On what?!?!?" Eddie chimed in.

"Was she asian?" Abby asked.

"Seems racist but yes."

"Women like Nancy assume the asian nail techs don't understand very much english so they tend to just talk on their phones the whole time they're getting their nails done."

"Ah, got it. Seems worth a try."

"OK, we'll look into it tomorrow. Good luck on the pro round of the tournament, buddy."

"Thanks. Good luck at the nail salaon."
