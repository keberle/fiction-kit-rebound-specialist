## Scene 12 — Quiet Dinner

"—no, I'm serious. He came out of the porta-potty on my backswing, trying to pitch out of the rough, live...on TV."

"I have to ask..."

"Bogey. Yeah, I finished in the money but just barely."

"Clearly the fault of the whoever put that porta-potty there."

"My point exactly." Mara giggled a little. "Can I make a confession?"

"This is my first date since..."

"...your son?"

"Yeah," she admitted adjusting her napkin on her lap again.

"You don't talk about him much."

"Alex. I named him after a boy that lived down the street from me as a kid. Always loved that name."

"And the boy?"

"Not so much. He broke my pink barbie car."

"And you named your son that anyway?"

"It's not the name's fault."

"Big of you."

"Miss him?"

"Every time I'm away. He's with my parents."

"Nice to have family support."

"It's not just nice, it's the only way this works."

"Sounds like they're very supportive."

"They better be, this is my dad's fault after all."

"Dad's fault? How?"

"He was the head of grounds at Kapalua."

"Oh, wow. That course is—"

"Yeah, it is and his pride and joy."

"So you grew up playing there?"

"Yeah, no pressure, right? I grew up getting golf tips from visiting pros and hustling tourists in skins games."

"And your son?"

"Still too young for clubs but don't think my dad isn't counting days."

"Runs in the family, then?"

"In more ways than one." she said as her eyes darted down again.

"Oh, dad was—"

"—yeah, he was."

"Anyone I would know?"

"Yeah. But he's—"

"—not available."

"Right. And this is the first date since him?"

"Can you blame me? Clearly my taste in men is broken."

"I'll try not to take it personally."

She laughed.

"Nervous about tomorrow?"

"Nah, it's not a point event and whatever prize money there is, will almost always be donated back to the cause."

"But you have to admit that it would be nice to—"

"—beat the short skirt off that blonde bimbo? Yeah."

"I am pretty sure that video would go viral."

She laughed again. "She's everything that annoys me about professional golf."

"More entertainment than competition?"

"Exactly. She gets views because she's young and blonde and she can hit the crap out of a driver."

"And I'm pretty sure in some of her videos you can see her—"

"—yes, yes you can."

"Not your style of golf?"

"Not at all. I came up with women like Michele Wie, Annika Sorenstam, Paula Creamer and sure they were all attractive women but it wasn't about their looks or likes or whatever."

"But you can't let the new generation of influencers destroy what you loved. It's still a game, right?"

"Yeah, good point. It's just different for women."

"How so?"

"Men can get focused and they are praised for their intensity. That same behavior from women gets you labeled a 'cold bitch'. It's just as hard for us to come back from time away as it is for men but we have to put on a pretty little smile while we do it."

"Fair. Maybe don't smile for them."

"Then who? You?"

"Your son. Your dad. The little girls who are getting tips from pros and hustling tourists in skins games right now."

She smiled. Possibly for Doogan that time.

"—maybe, hard to say." she said as the elevator doors of her hotel opened.

"Hard to say? If you could, you would and I think you know it."

"Play in a men's event? I don't know. The drive is the big factor."

It was probably the slowest walk from the elevator to a room in the history of that hotel.

"Choose Port Royal or some other shorter, more technical course."

"Maybe. It's fun to think about. The money is definitely better in the PGA. One win in a men's event would cover me for a couple of years on the islands with my son, living pretty comfy."

"You wouldn't miss it?"

"I'd miss some things." she said as she arrived at her door.

"This is you?"

"Yeah, thank you for walking me." she leaned forward and kissed Doogan. He reached a hand to her waist.

"That was nice."

"Maybe you should—" her phone rang. She glanced down to her hand. "That's—"

"I get it. He's probably wondering how the tournament is going."

"He's too young to get any of it. I think he just likes to hear my voice and see me on Facetime."

"Of course he does. Get a good night's rest, Mara. Big day in the morning."

"Good night, Doogan. Thank you." she waved her key card over the lock and backed into the room "Hey, buddy! I can see you!" as her voice trailed away.
