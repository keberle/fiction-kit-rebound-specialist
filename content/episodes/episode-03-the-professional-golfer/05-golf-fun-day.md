## Scene 5 — Golf Fun Day

"Mother fu—"

"She certainly sounds like a seasoned golfer." Doogan had found his crew.

Brenda Atwood stood before a worn patch of grass, driver in hand, looking like victim of a conspiracy between club and ball.

"I'd say she has the shanks but the shanks might be an improvement." Mara sighed.

"It says you're supposed to extend down through the ball." Marcus read from his phone.

"Extend?!" Brenda gestured at the ground. "I am damn near digging a ditch here."

"Coffee?" Doogan held up a cardboard tray with four cups.

"There's a video." Marcus turned the phone. "See? This guy—"

"Marcus, that's a kid. He's like twelve."

"He has two million followers."

Mara stood, arms crossed, watching Brenda and Marcus hunt for answers on YouTube.

"Morning." Doogan gestured coffees toward her.

Mara turned. "You're early. A day early. Best Ball isn't until tomorrow."

"Figured you might need coffee."

"If this keeps up, I might need something stronger."

He handed one to Mara. She sipped, made a face—not quite approval, not rejection either.

"Not what you usually drink?"

"It's fine."

Brenda spotted him. "Oh thank God. You're the caddy, right?"

"Doogan."

"Brenda. This is Marcus." Mara introduced them.

"Thank God. Marcus is caddying tomorrow but I think we need advice about that."

Marcus looked up from his phone. "Hi. Do you know anything about hip rotation?"

Doogan handed him a cup. "Vanilla latte, extra shot, oat milk."

Marcus blinked. "How did you—"

"Lucky guess." Doogan offered the last cup to Brenda. "Caramel macchiato, extra whip."

Brenda took it like he'd handed her gold. "Okay, you're officially my favorite person here."

Marcus sipped his latte. Paused. "This is perfect."

"I aim to please."

Mara watched this with something between suspicion and curiosity. "You didn't ask what anyone wanted."

"Coffee shops have patterns. Brenda strikes me as a caramel person. Marcus has that extra-shot energy even at six AM. And you—" He gestured at her cup. "—drink whatever's in front of you because you're thinking about something else."

"Golf."

"You know we don't need caddies today, right?"

"I'm just trying to get my money's worth."

Brenda broke the tension. "Can one of you please tell me why this is happening?"

"May I?" Doogan asked Mara.

"Be my guest."

Doogan walked over, moved Marcus aside gently, positioned himself right in front of Brenda, crouched down close to the tee.

"I tend to think of the golf swing as a poem."

"Oh. My. God." Mara rolled her eyes hard.

"The opening phrase will always be the grip."

"Stop it—"

Doogan laughed, waved his hand like erasing words.

"No, that seems nice," Brenda said.

"It's from a movie. Good Lord." Mara rolled her eyes.

"Let all the advice you found online go," Doogan said.

"What do you mean?"

"Let it go. It's junk." Doogan picked her ball off the tee, offered it. She took it, confused. "What do you notice?"

"It's a ball."

"Is it heavy?"

"No."

"Squishy?"

"No. Hard with dimples."

"Right. Light, hard shell, dimples. Made to go far with limited effort. Physics handles spin and loft. The ball wants you to succeed. You don't need hip rotation, shoulder drive, follow-through, wrist snap, any of that."

"But YouTube—" Marcus interrupted.

"—is a graveyard of bad advice."

"So then what?" Brenda asked.

"First, shorter club." He swapped her driver for an eight iron.

"It's so much shorter."

"More forgiving. Stance: shoulder width, stable. Like a tripod on a camera. Less your base moves, less you compensate up top."

"But don't I turn into—"

"No. Keep your base stable and still. Address the ball."

"Hello, ball." Marcus chuckled.

"Line up in the exact position you want when you strike." Doogan crouched. "What do you notice about the club head?"

"It's flush with the ball."

"Exactly. Hit it twisted this way, ball slices. Twisted that way, hooks. Get the club back to this point, every time. Loosen shoulders, don't strangle the grip. Just tight enough it doesn't fly out. Nothing more."

"But don't I have to power it up, 'grip it and rip it'?"

"We'll cover John Daly at the bar. For now, loose and easy. Ball is light, engineered. Just get the club back to this point. The less you move base, shoulders, hips, the better. Take a swing."

"Don't you have to move?"

"You're not going to hit me. You're going to hit that ball."

Brenda tried to relax. At the last minute, looked down the range.

"Hold on!"

"What?"

"What are you looking at?"

"Where the ball's going?"

"We'll watch for you. You watch the ball. Every time you hit it, describe what the club head looked like when it made contact. To do that, what will you need?"

"Focus on the ball. Right."

"But how will I hit my target?"

"When you walk up, watch your target. Setting stance, watch target. Lining up club head, watch target. After that, aiming's done. If you did it right and club head makes it back to that spot, you'll be on target. Most importantly, relax."

Doogan didn't move, despite making Brenda uncomfortable being that close.

Brenda took a deep inhale, relaxed hands and shoulders, lined up the club.

"Breathe."

She exhaled. Wound back, head down until arms couldn't go comfortably further, then one smooth motion down. Crisp slicing sound. Arms flung straight toward the fairway. Ball arced long, landed soft about ninety yards away.

"That felt..."

"Effortless?"

"Yeah."

"I got it!" Marcus hopped, gesturing to his phone.

"Nice! Post it, hashtag it!" Brenda said back.

"Hit a few more. Before you start your backswing, say that word."

"Which word?"

"Effortless."

"Out loud?"

"For now, yes."

Doogan headed back to Mara.

"Caddy and swing coach?" she asked.

"The second one's on the house."

"That was impressive."

"You don't need to warm up?"

"Effortless," Brenda repeated. Another clean shot.

"If she's going to hit like that tomorrow, maybe I should. Before you got here, I assumed bottom of the pack but now..."

"Tomorrow's Best Ball so she'll just follow you around. But the day after is a scramble."

"This is a celebrity Pro-Am so it's pretty forgiving, but it looked hopeless half an hour ago. Nice work."

"Thank you."

"I'm going to hit a few. Should I expect pointers?"

"I've seen your drive on TV. You won't need advice from me."

Commotion behind them. They turned. Crowd of press and fans moving in a clump. Center: Candy Williams in a cherry red skirt too short for LPGA standards, thin blonde woman following.

"Who's the matching blonde with Candy?"

"That's Tilly London, reality TV star. Almost a Kardashian." Marcus interrupted.

"What kind of golf bag is that?"

"Louis Vuitton. Golf shoes are Manolos."

"I don't think I've seen those in the pro shop."

"You need to hang out at better pro shops." Mara fired back.

"She has nearly five million followers. Between her and Candy, eight million. This is the influencer event right now." Marcus added.

"Lovely." Mara said flatly.

"I have a feeling you're going to feel better about this soon."

"Unlikely."

Tilly handed her bag to her assistant, pulled a driver—high-end, brand new, never practice-swung. Fetched a sparkling white ball from a wire bucket, dropped it on turf, lined up, posed for a shot.

"Keep watching." Doogan reassured.

Tilly wound up, left knee drifting in like batting cages, unwound. Thrush of air, thud. Turf and dirt sprung from tee. Ball just dribbled forward.

"Mother fu—"

"This is good coffee." Doogan took a sip.

Mara smiled.
