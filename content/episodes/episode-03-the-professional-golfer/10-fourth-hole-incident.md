## Scene 10 — Fourth Hole Incident

"Here we go." Mara was clearly annoyed as we approached the fourth tee box. "Can they never tee off, like normal players?"

"Apparently not," Doogan followed, carrying her clubs.

Brenda and Marcus came up on the right side of them, twisting to get a view. Brenda did her best blonde bimbo impersonation "Tour card or OnlyFans?  Tour card or OnlyFans? How does a girl decice?"

Mara laughed.  Candy turned and shot Brenda a look of pure daggers.

"I am not sure she's a fan," Marcus said, still laughing.

"Excuse me, Ms. Williams you're up." a young woman, a tour official holding a clipboard said from the back of the tee box.

Candy shot her a look of annoyance before looking back and Brenda and Mara with disdain.

She bent down, exaggerating her bend to show just how short her silky red skirt really was before placing the tee in the turf, followed by the ball.

"Was that necessary?" Mara asked, rolling her eyes.

"I have a feeling her social media fanbase would say yes."

"All true golf fans, I'm sure." Winston added.

Mara laughed.

Candy stretched back her club slowly, paused and then whipped her arms, twisting her torso and crushing the ball off of the tee.  The crowd responded approvingly.

"265 maybe—" Winston said as it landed.

"270." Mara said flatly.

"She can hit the driver," Doogan observed.

"I wonder if its one of those counterweight things," Marcus added. "Like her booty whips her arms around faster or something."

"BBL Powered! Sounds about right." Mara added.

Candy looked back at Mara and her group with disdain before changing expressions and posing for Tilly's selfie, dropping her driver and heading down the fairway, her caddy rushing to retrieve the club and keep up.

Moments later the media gathering had thinned considerably and only the smaller contingent following Mara and Brenda around the course remained.  "Ms. Atwood.  Ms. Palani" the tournament official announced. "You'll just need to pause while—"

"Oh, don't worry, sweetie." Brenda reached accepted the driver from Winston's extended hand. "I don't think I could hit anywhere near their spot."

The assitant acknowledged with a smile.

Picking up on the tension, Winston spoke up. "You know, Ms. Attwood—"

"Brenda. I keep telling you—"

"Right, Brenda. My wife loves your Britney Spears impersonation and well—"

"It would seem fitting given the last group through," Marcus added. "And it would be TikTok gold."

Without pausing, Brenda's entire demeanor changed.  Her voice went up to an almost whiney pitch and she repeated much of what Tilly London had said before her shot, verbatim.

Brenda rolled her shoulders back before twisting forward again, slicing into the rough on the right side of fairway, about one hundred yards down.

"Oops, I did it again.  I sliced off the teeeeee—"

The media captured the moment, Doogan, Winston, Mara and Marcus all laughed.

"Got lost in the rough, oh, baby, baby"

"Ms. Palani?" the offical prompted. "You might want to—"

Mara was distracted by Brenda and hadn't noticed the tournament official. She placed the tee and the ball in place, walked around the back side of the ball to examine the fairway before stepping up to the ball and centering herself.

"Ms. Palani?" the official repeated but was unheard over Brenda continuing her impersonation with the paparazzi tuned in.

Mara was trying not to laugh. 

"Remember? Effort—" Doogan said, trying to keep her mind off the game for a bit.

"—I'm not saying that." she cut him off.

Brenda went quiet. The tournament official had her hand up as if she was going to speak.

Mara took a deep breath, let it out and said "Effortless." before taking a slow, graceful backswing, almost picture perfect pause and then it happened. As if a a rubber band had been stretched to just shy of the breaking point before unleashing its energy, Mara unwound her stroke and the sound of wind and the crisp sound of clean contact followed.

"Wow." Winston said, unable to move.

"Wow is right."

"Two-seventy—"

"No. More."

Further down the fairway, Candy heard something she was not used to hearing at all, ever.

"Fore!" echoed out from the tee box area. Unused to hearing it, even as a pro, Candy turned to look up the fairway but it was too late. The ball sailed about 15 feed beside her, landing about 8 yards past her and bouncing before rolling and finally stopping, nearly fifteen yards in front of her.

"What the hell was that?" Tilly exclaimed, loosing her instagram worthy pose.

"That bitch!" Candy exclaimed before realizing that she was still on camera by the paparazzi.  She tried to smile it off but the moment had happened.

---

Back on the tee box, Mara was frozen in her follow through pose, mostly in shock.

"Ms. Palani, that will be a two stroke penalty for hitting into another group."

"Worth it!" Brenda replied.

"Definitely." Winston added.

Marcus called out "Hashtag that, bitches!"
