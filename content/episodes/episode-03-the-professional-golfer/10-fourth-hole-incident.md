## Scene 10 — Fourth Hole Incident

"Here we go." Mara approached the fourth tee box. "Can they never tee off, like normal players?"

"Apparently not." Doogan followed, carrying her clubs. They approached the next hole after a surprisingly solid first three holes of the scramble round of the tournament and were now watching Candy and Tilly put on quite the show on the fourth tee box.

Brenda and Marcus came up on the right side of them. Brenda did her best blonde impersonation. "Tour card or OnlyFans? Tour card or OnlyFans? How does a girl decide?"

Mara laughed. Candy turned and shot Brenda a look.

"I am not sure she's a fan."

"Excuse me, Ms. Williams, you're up." the tournament official interrupted.

Candy shot her a look before looking back at Brenda and Mara.

She bent down, placed the tee in the turf, followed by the ball.

"Was that necessary?"

"I have a feeling her social media fanbase would say yes."

"All true golf fans, I'm sure."

Mara laughed.

Candy stretched back her club slowly, paused, then whipped her arms, twisting her torso and crushing the ball off the tee. The crowd responded.

"265 maybe—" Winston added.

"270." Mara replied, flatly.

"She can hit the driver."

"I wonder if it's one of those counterweight things. Like her booty whips her arms around faster or something."

"BBL Powered. Sounds about right." Mara tried not to laugh.

Candy looked back at Mara and her group before changing expressions and posing for Tilly's selfie, dropping her driver and heading down the fairway, her caddy rushing to retrieve the club.

Moments later the media gathering had thinned considerably. "Ms. Atwood. Ms. Palani, you'll just need to pause while—" the tournmament official spoke up.

"Oh, don't worry, sweetie." Brenda accepted the driver from Winston's extended hand. "I don't think I could hit anywhere near their spot."

The official acknowledged with a smile.

"You know, Brenda—"

"I keep telling you—"

"Right. My wife loves your Britney Spears impersonation and well—"

"It would seem fitting given the last group through. And it would be TikTok gold."

Brenda's entire demeanor changed. Her voice went up to an almost whiny pitch and she repeated much of what Tilly London had said before her shot, verbatim.

Brenda rolled her shoulders back before twisting forward again, slicing into the rough on the right side of the fairway, about one hundred yards down.

"Oops, I did it again. I sliced off the teeeeee—"

The media captured the moment. Doogan, Winston, Mara, and Marcus all laughed.

"Got lost in the rough, oh, baby, baby."

"Ms. Palani?" The official prompted. "You might want to—"

Mara was distracted by Brenda. She placed the tee and the ball, walked around to examine the fairway, then stepped up to the ball and centered herself.

"Ms. Palani?"

Mara was trying not to laugh.

"Remember? Effort—"

"—I'm not saying that."

Brenda went quiet. The tournament official had her hand up as if to catch Mara's attention.

Mara took a deep breath, let it out and said "Effortless" before taking a slow, graceful backswing, almost picture perfect pause and then it happened. As if a rubber band had been stretched to just shy of the breaking point before unleashing its energy, Mara unwound her stroke and the sound of wind and the crisp sound of clean contact followed.

"Wow."

"Wow is right."

"Two-seventy—"

"No. More."

Further down the fairway, Candy heard something she was not used to hearing.

"Fore!" echoed out from the tee box area. Unused to hearing it, Candy turned to look up the fairway but it was too late. The ball sailed about fifteen feet beside her, landing about eight yards past her and bouncing before rolling and finally stopping, nearly fifteen yards in front of her.

"What the hell was that?"

"That bitch!" Candy exclaimed before realizing that she was still on camera. She tried to smile it off but the moment had happened.

Back on the tee box, Mara was frozen in her follow through pose.

"Ms. Palani, that will be a two stroke penalty for hitting into another group."

"Worth it!"

"Definitely."

"Hashtag that, bitches!"
