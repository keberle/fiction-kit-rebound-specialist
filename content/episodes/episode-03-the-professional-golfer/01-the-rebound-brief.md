## Scene 1 — The Rebound Brief

"Are you ever going to give me a price, Eddie?"

"What's a bigger share of eleven hundred endorsement deals worth to you?" Eddie loosened his shoulder, wound back, caught his pitching wedge clean. Ball dropped four feet from the hole.

"Yeah, yeah. I've heard this from every publicist in LA." Jake followed Eddie onto the green.

Doogan carried his putter, gave Eddie space.

"She's playing top-tier golf, Jake. Barely clearing what? A million a year? Is that even half what Korda or Ko are clearing? And don't even start me on the chick with the big ass, what's her name?"

"Candy Williams. But Mara appeals to a different demographic."

"A publicist tell you that? They show you a pie chart? Color copied at Kinko's?"

"Eddie—" Doogan tried to slow him down.

"Look, you're right, Jake. That's not what we do. I don't have a prospectus or whatever bullshit they handed you that's probably lining your garbage can, or you wouldn't be here."

"So what do you do?"

"We're a breath of fresh air. What she needs, when she needs it. And this weekend, you're going to need it. Celebrity Pro-Am in LA, no other big events. This thing's crawling with reporters, paparazzi, sports apparel companies—it's a STEM fundraiser. Mark Zuckerberg's coming and that douchebag doesn't leave the Bay Area for anything but a congressional hearing."

"Eddie!" Doogan spoke up.

"Yeah. There are endorsement deals this week." Jake pulled his driver out.

"And you want your girl having fun. Playing great golf, sure. But having fun. It's a celebrity Pro-Am. This is where she reminds the world she's at the top of her game and still remembers it's a game."

"You're overselling." Doogan set up his tee shot.

"I'm accurately selling. There's a difference."

Jake almost smiled. "Mara Palani isn't—she's not going to suddenly become warm and fuzzy because some charming guy shows up."

"I'm not that charming." Doogan faded his drive more than he wanted.

Eddie laughed. "See? Already selling himself short. That's the humility that works. You can't teach that. It's authentic."

Jake looked at Doogan. "You've been quiet."

"Eddie talks enough for both of us."

"I'm getting that." Jake stepped to the tee, set his ball. "Tiger Woods came back. Phil Mickelson. Jordan Spieth. Steve Stricker. Men make comebacks all the time." He swung. Ball sliced right, landed rough. "Name one woman who came back after childbirth and won a major."

Silence. Doogan glanced at Eddie, who for once had nothing.

Jake collected his tee. "Michelle Wie? That was injury, and she was young. Alison Lee came back fast, struggled with mom guilt, never won a major. For men, comebacks are expected. For women after a baby?" He shook his head. "Mara's pulling off something almost nobody does. She's shooting better now than before her son was born."

Doogan put his driver back, grabbed the cart, headed down to the fairway. "Then this isn't about her game."

"No." Jake's voice went flat. "This is about the other inequality. Top ten LPGA players make a third of what PGA players make. Drop to top twenty, maybe a quarter. And Mara can't hit every tournament—she's flying back and forth to the islands to be with her son."

Eddie leaned on his club.

"To make this work," Jake continued, "to balance her son Alex and staying on tour, she needs endorsements. But the focus to get her game back to this level—it's given her a harder edge. She's short with interviewers. Not the sweet, charismatic young woman she was before. She's—"

"—focused," Doogan said. Jake turned. "Tiger was focused when he came back."

"Exactly." Jake's jaw tightened. "Tiger's focused, he's praised for his mental game. Mara's focused, she's a cold bitch. That's the double standard."

Doogan lined up his shot.

Jake watched. "She shouldn't have to be locked in on her game and press-friendly at the same time. But here we are. If you can help her enjoy this week, smile a little, be more open in interviews—maybe I can lock in some endorsement deals. Then she won't have to hit as many tour stops. More time with her son."

Doogan swung. Ball sailed long, landed shy of the green. "A week at a golf resort helping someone remember why she loves this?" He returned the club. "That sounds like a nice change of pace."

Eddie grinned. "That's what I'm talking about. Enthusiasm. You hear that, Jake? He's already in."

"I'm considering."

"He's in. Doogan doesn't consider—he commits or walks. And he's not walking. Look at his face. That's commitment face."

"This is my regular face. Where is it?"

Jake watched them. Something shifted. "The Hidden Hills. Rancho Palos Verdes. Hybrid celebrity Pro-Am slash women-in-STEM scholarship fundraiser."

"Beautiful venue," Eddie said. "Great food. Ocean views. See what I'm saying? This is basically a vacation that pays."

"Her regular caddy?"

"Visiting family back East. I gave Jenny the week off. Paid her full rate anyway. Tournament organizers need a substitute."

"That's where I come in."

"Monday night there's a welcome gala. Charity auction. One lot is caddying for Mara all week. You win it." Jake paused. "Makes it seem natural. Just some guy who wanted to support the cause and got lucky."

Doogan lined up. "How much am I bidding?"

"Whatever it takes. Three or four thousand should do it."

Eddie whistled. "Steep for charity."

"Steep for access." Jake met Doogan's eyes. "Tournament runs Tuesday through Friday—skills competitions, Pro-Am rounds, exhibition finale. No tour pressure. Just golf and fun."

Eddie pulled his pitching wedge, sized up his approach.

"When does it start?"

"Gala's tomorrow evening. Tournament kicks off Tuesday morning."

"That's fast."

"That's necessary."

They walked toward the green.

Eddie filled the silence. "So full week at a resort, caddying for an LPGA pro, helping her have some fun. That's the play?"

"That's the play."

"And she doesn't know."

"She doesn't know." Jake's tone went flat. "She'll think you're just some auction winner who happens to be competent."

"Very competent," Eddie said. "Played college golf. Knows the game. Won't embarrass himself."

"I'm standing right here."

"Making my point. The humility. You can't fake that."

They reached Eddie's ball. He pulled a club, studied the distance.

Doogan crouched at his ball, read the lie. Clean shot to the green. "Then I'll see you Monday night."
