## Scene 1 — The Rebound Brief

"Are you ever going to get around to giving me a price, Eddie?"

"What is a bigger share of eleven hundred endorsement deals worth to you?".  Eddie loosened his shoulder before winding back and catching his pitching wedge cleanly, dropping the ball gingerly on the green, four feet from the hole.

"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard this salespitch from every publicist in LA." Jake followed Eddie up on to the green of the fourteenth hole at Willow Creek.

Doogan was following along, carrying his putter and just giving Eddie his space.

"She's playing top tier golf, Jake. But she's barely clearing what? A million a year? Is that even half of what Korda or Ko are clearing? And don't mention even start me on the chick with the big ass, what's her name?"

"Candy...Candy Williams. But Mara is appealing to a different demegraphic."

"A publicist tell you that, Jake? Did they show you a pie chart? They did, didn't they? A pie chart they had color copied at Kinko's?"

"Eddie" Doogan tried to hit pause on is best friend.

"Look! You're right, Jake. That's not what we do. I don't have a prospectus or whatever bullshit they handed you that I'm guessing is lining your garbage can now or you wouldn't be out here today."

"So what is it that you do?"

"We're a breath of fresh air in a stale room. We just what she needs, just when she needs it and this weekend, you're going to need it. You're at a celebrity Pro Am in LA with no other big events in town. This thing is going to be crawling with reporters, paparazzi, sports apparel companies...its a god damn STEM fundraiser, Mark Zuckerberg is going to be here and that rich douchebag doesn't leave the bay area for anything but a congressional hearing."

"Eddie!" Doogan spoke up, trying to hit the pause button again.

"Yes, there are some possible endorsement deals to be had this week." Jake said pulling the driver out of his bag.

"And you want your girl having fun. Playing great golf, sure. But having fun. Its a celebrity Pro Am. This is the place for her to remind the world that she's at the top of her game and still remembers that its a game."

"You're overselling." Doogan said, setting up his tee shot.

"I'm accurately selling. There's a difference."

Jake almost smiled. "Mara Palani isn't just—she's not going to suddenly become warm and fuzzy because some charming guy shows up."

"I'm not that charming." Doogan said, fading his drive a little more than he wanted.

Eddie laughed. "See? Already selling himself short. That's the humility that works, Jake. That's what I'm talking about. You can't teach that. It's authentic."

Jake looked at Doogan. "You've been quiet."

"Eddie talks enough for both of us."

"I'm getting that impression." Jake stepped to the tee box, set his ball. "Tiger Woods came back. Phil Mickelson. Jordan Spieth. Steve Stricker. Men make comebacks all the time." He swung. Ball sliced right, landed rough. "Name one woman who came back after childbirth and won a major."

Silence. Doogan glanced at Eddie, who for once had nothing to say.

Jake collected his tee. "Michelle Wie? That was injury, and she was young. Alison Lee came back fast, struggled with mom guilt, never won a major. For men, comebacks are expected. For women after having a baby?" He shook his head. "Mara's pulling off something almost nobody does. She's shooting better now than before her son was born."

Doogan put his driver back into his bag, grabbed the hand cart and headed down on to the fairway. "Then this isn't about her game."

"No." Jake's voice went flat. "This is about the other inequality. Top ten LPGA players make less than a third of what PGA players make. Drop to top twenty, it's maybe a quarter. And Mara can't hit every tournament—she's flying back and forth to the islands to be with her son."

Eddie leaned on his club, actually listening.

"To make this work," Jake continued, "to balance being with her son, Alex and staying on tour, she needs endorsements. But the focus she's had to show—the discipline to get her game back to this level—it's given her a harder edge. She's short with interviewers. She's not the sweet, charismatic young woman she was before. She's-"

"-focused," Doogan said.  Jake turned and made eye contact. "Tiger was focused when he came back."

"Exactly." Jake's jaw tightened. "Tiger's focused, he's praised for his mental game. Mara's focused, she's a cold bitch. That's the double standard."

Doogan lined up his shot.

Jake watched him. "She shouldn't have to be locked in on her game and press-friendly at the same time. But here we are. If you can help her enjoy this week, smile a little, be more open in interviews—maybe I can get some endorsement deals locked in. Then she won't have to hit as many tour stops. She can spend more time with her son."

Doogan swung. Ball sailed long, landed just shy of the green. "A week at a golf resort helping someone remember why she loves this?" He returned the club to his bag. "Honestly, that sounds like a nice change of pace."

Eddie's grin returned. "That's what I'm talking about. Enthusiasm. You hear that, Jake? He's already in."

"I'm considering."

"He's in. Doogan doesn't consider—he commits or he walks. And he's not walking. Look at his face. That's commitment face."

"This is my regular face. Where is it?"

Jake watched them, something shifting in his expression. Less guarded. "The Hidden Hills. Rancho Palos Verdes. Its a hybrid celebrity Pro Am slash womenin STEM scholarship fundraiser."

"Beautiful venue," Eddie said. "Great food. Ocean views. You see what I'm saying, Doogan? This is basically a vacation that pays."

"Her regular caddy?"

"Visiting family back East," Jake said. "I gave Jenny the week off. Paid her full rate anyway. Tournament organizers are looking for a substitute."

"And that's where I come in."

"Monday night there's a welcome gala at the resort. Charity auction. One of the lots is caddying for Mara all week. You win it." Jake paused. "Makes it seem natural. Like you're just some guy who wanted to support the cause and got lucky."

Doogan lined up his shot. "How much am I bidding?"

"Whatever it takes. Three or four thousand should do it."

Eddie whistled. "Steep for charity."

"Steep for access." Jake met Doogan's eyes. "The tournament runs Tuesday through Friday—skills competitions, Pro-Am rounds, exhibition finale. No tour pressure. Just golf and fun."

Eddie removed his pitching wedge from his bag and sized up his approach shot.

"When does it start?"

"Gala's tomorrow evening. Tournament kicks off Tuesday morning."

"That's fast."

"That's necessary."

They walked toward the green, golf bags rattling on hand carts.

Eddie filled the silence like he always did. "So we're talking full week at a resort, caddying for an LPGA pro, helping her have some fun. That's the play?"

"That's the play."

"And she doesn't know."

"She doesn't know." Jake's tone went flat. "She'll think you're just some auction winner who happens to be competent."

"Very competent," Eddie said. "Played college golf. Knows the game. Won't embarrass himself."

"I'm standing right here."

"Making my point for me. The humility. You can't fake that, Jake."

They reached Eddie's ball. He pulled a club, studied the distance.

Doogan walked to his own ball, crouched, read the lie. Good position. Clean shot to the green. "Then I'll see you Monday night."
