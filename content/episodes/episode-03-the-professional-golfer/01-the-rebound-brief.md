## Scene 1 — The Rebound Brief

"That's exactly what I'm saying, Jake. We're the ones to handle this situation. The basics will be figured out over time. We can get straight to the inner details."

Eddie addressed his ball, knees bent, club head hovering. The fourteenth tee box at Willow Creek overlooked the fairway sloping toward distant greens. Sunday afternoon sun painted the course gold.

Jake stood three feet back, arms crossed, watching Eddie's setup with the cautious interest of someone who'd heard pitches before. "You make it sound simple."

Eddie swung. Clean contact. The ball arced high, dropped center fairway.

"Beautiful." Eddie collected his tee. "And it *is* simple. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Doogan's good at this."

Doogan leaned on his driver, watching Jake's face. The man wanted to believe but wasn't there yet.

"Simple," Jake said. "Mara's... complicated."

"Complicated is our specialty." Eddie gestured at Doogan. "Right?"

"You're overselling."

"I'm accurately selling. There's a difference."

Jake almost smiled. "Mara Palani isn't just—she's not going to suddenly become warm and fuzzy because some charming guy shows up."

"I'm not charming."

Eddie laughed. "See? Already selling himself short. That's the humility that works, Jake. That's what I'm talking about. You can't teach that. It's authentic."

"Eddie."

"What? I'm making a point. You came to me with a problem—"

"I asked you for advice."

"Advice, help, same thing. You said Mara's brilliant, you said she's playing the best golf of her life, you said sponsors won't touch her. So here we are, fourteen holes into a round, and I'm telling you we can help."

Jake looked at Doogan. "You've been quiet."

"Eddie talks enough for both of us."

"I'm getting that impression." Jake stepped to the tee box, set his ball. "Tiger Woods came back. Phil Mickelson. Jordan Spieth. Steve Stricker. Men make comebacks all the time." He swung. Ball sliced right, landed rough. "Name one woman who came back after childbirth and won a major."

Silence. Doogan glanced at Eddie, who for once had nothing to say.

Jake collected his tee. "Michelle Wie? That was injury, and she was young. Alison Lee came back fast, struggled with mom guilt, never won a major. For men, comebacks are expected. For women after having a baby?" He shook his head. "Mara's pulling off something almost nobody does. She's shooting better now than before her son was born."

Doogan stepped to the tee box. Set his ball. "Then this isn't about her game."

"No." Jake's voice went flat. "This is about the other inequality. Top ten LPGA players make less than a third of what PGA players make. Drop to top twenty, it's maybe a quarter. And Mara can't hit every tournament—she's flying back and forth to the islands to be with her son."

Eddie leaned on his club, actually listening.

"To make this work," Jake continued, "to balance being with her son, Alex and staying on tour, she needs endorsements. But the focus she's had to show—the discipline to get her game back to this level—it's given her a harder edge. She's short with interviewers. She's not the sweet, charismatic young woman she was before. She's-"

"-focused," Doogan said.  Jake turned and made eye contact.

"So was Tiger when he was coming back," Eddie said.

"Exactly." Jake's jaw tightened. "Tiger's focused, he's praised for his mental game. Mara's focused, she's a cold bitch. That's the double standard."

Doogan lined up his shot.

Jake watched him. "She shouldn't have to be locked in on her game and press-friendly at the same time. But here we are. If you can help her enjoy this week, smile a little, be more open in interviews—maybe I can get some endorsement deals locked in. Then she won't have to hit as many tour stops. She can spend more time with her son."

Doogan swung. Ball sailed long, landed just past Eddie's. "A week at a golf resort helping someone remember why she loves this?" He collected his tee. "Honestly, that sounds like a nice change of pace."

Eddie's grin returned. "That's what I'm talking about. Enthusiasm. You hear that, Jake? He's already in."

"I'm considering."

"He's in. Doogan doesn't consider—he commits or he walks. And he's not walking. Look at his face. That's commitment face."

"This is my regular face."

Jake watched them, something shifting in his expression. Less guarded. "The Hidden Hills Celebrity Pro-Am. Week-long charity tournament at the resort in Rancho Palos Verdes. Benefits women's STEM scholarships."

"Beautiful venue," Eddie said. "Great food. Ocean views. You see what I'm saying, Doogan? This is basically a vacation that pays."

"Her regular caddy?"

"Visiting family back East," Jake said. "I gave Jenny the week off. Paid her full rate anyway. Tournament organizers are looking for a substitute."

"And that's where I come in."

"Monday night there's a welcome gala at the resort. Charity auction. One of the lots is caddying for Mara all week. You win it." Jake paused. "Makes it seem natural. Like you're just some guy who wanted to support the cause and got lucky."

Doogan lined up his shot. "How much am I bidding?"

"Whatever it takes. Three or four thousand should do it."

Eddie whistled. "Steep for charity."

"Steep for access." Jake met Doogan's eyes. "The tournament runs Tuesday through Friday—skills competitions, Pro-Am rounds, exhibition finale. No tour pressure. Just golf and fun."

Doogan swung. Ball sailed long, landed just past Eddie's. He bent, collected his tee.

"When does it start?"

"Gala's tomorrow evening. Tournament kicks off Tuesday morning."

"That's fast."

"That's necessary."

They walked toward the fairway, golf bags rattling, shoes crunching cart path.

Eddie filled the silence like he always did. "So we're talking full week at a resort, caddying for an LPGA pro, helping her have some fun. That's the play?"

"That's the play."

"And she doesn't know."

"She doesn't know." Jake's tone went flat. "She'll think you're just some auction winner who happens to be competent."

"Very competent," Eddie said. "Played college golf. Knows the game. Won't embarrass himself."

"I'm standing right here."

"Making my point for me. The humility. You can't fake that, Jake."

They reached Eddie's ball. He pulled a club, studied the distance.

Doogan walked to his own ball, crouched, read the lie. Good position. Clean shot to the green. "Then I'll see you Monday night."
