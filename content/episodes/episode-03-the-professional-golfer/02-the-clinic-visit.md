## Scene 2 — The Clinic Visit

"And you're paying cash today?"

"That's right." Abby returned the clipboard. "No insurance."

"The nurse will call you back in a few minutes. Have a seat."

Abby moved to the waiting area. Two other patients: elderly man reading, young woman on her phone. Clinic smelled like antiseptic and air freshener covering something stale. Fluorescent lights hummed.

She adjusted her earpiece.

"I'm in." Low voice, pretended to check her phone.

Baxter's voice crackled. "Copy that. I've got the clinic's security camera feed. Two cameras in the lobby, one in the hallway. No cameras in exam rooms or staff area."

"What about coverage in the back?"

"Pretty standard. Cameras cover public areas, reception, main hallway. Nothing in treatment areas for privacy. But there's one room that's interesting—Exam Room 1, down at the end past the nurses' station. No camera anywhere near it. Not even in the hallway."

"That's unusual."

"Yeah. According to the appointment system, that room's only used by Nancy. She sees specific patients there, but I can't tell what kind yet. Scheduling notes are coded."

"Sarah Mitchell?"

Medical assistant at the doorway. Abby stood, followed her down the hallway. Beige walls, generic watercolors, exam room numbers. The assistant stopped at Room 4.

"Have a seat. Doctor will be with you shortly."

Door closed. Abby waited thirty seconds.

"Baxter, what do you see?"

"Hallway's clear. Nancy's at the nurses' station. Two other staff in exam rooms. You've got maybe three minutes before someone checks."

Abby cracked the door, slipped out. Empty left. Another corridor right. She moved quickly. Exam 5. Exam 6. Supply closet.

Far end of the hallway, past the branch: Exam Room 1. Nancy's room. No camera coverage. She started toward it.

"Abby, wait—Nancy just stood up. She's looking at something."

Abby froze. Too exposed. She pivoted, spotted another door.

"Staff Only."

Handle turned. Unlocked.

She slipped inside, eased the door shut. Small room—break table, microwave, lockers. Against the far wall: large beige metal filing cabinet. Five drawers, alphabet labels. Horizontal pulls, circular locks.

"Baxter, I'm in. Filing cabinet. Five drawers."

"Good. Try the top drawer."

Abby pulled. Locked. Second drawer. Also locked.

"All locked."

"Okay, okay, hold on." Typing sounds. "You need two paperclips. Can you find paperclips?"

Abby scanned. Cup on the break table—pens and paperclips. She grabbed two, straightened them. "Got them."

"Okay, these are barrel locks so you need to bend one into an L-shape for tension, and the other—"

"Wait." Abby froze. "Do you actually know how to pick locks?"

"Um... kind of..."

"What does 'kind of' mean?"

Pause. "I'm... reading about it. Right now."

"You're reading about it?"

"Yeah, on Reddit. Very detailed instructions! And pictures!"

"Baxter!" Hushed but sharp.

"Look, it's not that different from hacking, conceptually. You're just manipulating physical pins instead of digital—"

"Are we really learning lock-picking together while I'm actively breaking into a medical records room?"

Longer pause. Quieter: "When you put it that way, it does sound... less optimal."

Footsteps outside.

"Someone's coming."

"Nancy just left the nurses' station. Heading your way."

Abby's eyes swept. Locked drawers. No time. Then she spotted it—cardboard box on the floor next to the cabinet. Label: "TO BE SHREDDED." She crouched, rifled through. Patient intake forms. Appointment logs. And—there—printed patient list. Names, dates, notes. Several names crossed off in blue pen.

"Grab it!" Baxter blurted.

She shoved it into her purse, stood, moved toward the door.

Too late.

Door opened. Nancy stepped through, clipboard in hand, eyes cold and suspicious.

"What are you doing in here?"

"I'm so sorry. I got turned around looking for the bathroom."

Nancy's gaze flicked to the filing cabinet, then back. "This room is clearly marked 'Staff Only.'"

"I know, I just—"

"The bathroom's down the hall. Opposite direction." Nancy stepped fully in, blocking the doorway. "You were in Exam 4. That's three doors past the bathroom. You'd have to walk past it to get here."

Abby forced an apologetic expression. "I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention."

"Right." Nancy's eyes narrowed.

Abby slipped back into the exam room, closed the door shy of latching. Waited a beat, cracked it to confirm Nancy was gone.

On her way out, the receptionist noticed. "Ma'am?"

"Don't you have to check out or something?"

"No." Hushed voice. "All the information's fake, remember? And I'm not paying a bill."

"Good point."

Receptionist looked confused. "But the doctor will be ready in just—"

Abby walked out the front door into evening air. Didn't look back.
