## Scene 9 — Baxter Goes Undercover

"—and there she is, blonde woman, late forties, scrubs. That's her, right?"

Baxter stood near the reception desk, clipboard in hand. The clinic smelled like antiseptic and old magazines.

"That's Nancy." Abby's voice in his ear. "Don't stare at the camera."

"I'm not—"

"You're staring directly at it."

Baxter looked down at the clipboard Eddie had given him. Generic work order form, official-looking letterhead he'd designed himself. IT Services. Network connectivity issue. Building management sent him.

"She's leaving." Eddie this time. "Grabbing her purse. Heading for the door. We've got her on the front camera."

Nancy walked past without glancing at him. The front door chimed as she left.

"Okay." Baxter exhaled. "She's gone?"

"Confirmed. We're watching all the feeds. You've got maybe thirty minutes."

The temp receptionist looked up from her phone. Young, bored, probably covering someone's shift. "Can I help you?"

Baxter approached, held up the clipboard. "IT support. I'm here to check the network connections in the exam rooms. Building management called it in."

She glanced at the clipboard without reading it. "Sure. Do you need anything?"

"Just access to the rooms. Won't take long."

"They're all unlocked except—" She paused. "Well, Exam Room 1 is locked. Nancy keeps it locked."

"I'll need to check that one too. Network issues can happen anywhere."

The temp receptionist hesitated. Looked at the clipboard again. Looked at the locked door down the hall.

"Nancy usually handles that room herself."

"I understand. But if the network's down in there, it affects the whole system. I just need five minutes."

She picked up a key ring from the desk drawer. "Okay, but be quick. She gets... particular about her exam room."

"Two minutes. I promise."

He followed her down the hallway. Beige walls, fluorescent lights. Generic watercolor prints. The corridor branched, led toward the back of the building where the cameras didn't reach.

"You're doing great," Abby said quietly in his ear. "Just stay calm."

The temp unlocked Exam Room 1, pushed the door open. "There you go. Let me know if you need anything."

"Thanks."

She walked back toward reception.

Baxter stepped inside. Closed the door most of the way—not latched, just enough for privacy.

The room looked nothing like a standard exam room. He pulled his cell phone from his pocket to give them a view of the room.

No exam table. No counter with cotton swabs and tongue depressors. Instead: a hospital bed with rails, IV stand, breathing equipment mounted on the wall. Machines with digital displays, coiled tubing, tanks labeled with medical codes.

"You seeing this?" Baxter whispered.

"Yeah." Eddie's voice, quieter now. "What is that?"

Baxter moved closer, read the label on the nearest machine. "Philips Respironics."

"It's a... breathing machine. For respiratory support." Abby read from the internet search.

"Like a ventilator?"

"Similar. More portable. For long-term care."

"Why would Nancy have that in a clinic exam room?"

Baxter scanned the other equipment. "What is this stuff used for?  Its not in the othee exam rooms."

"This is hospice equipment. For palliative care." Abby responded.

"What the hell is Nancy doing with hospice equipment?" Abby asked.

"I don't know."

Two manila folders sat open on the small desk in the corner. Baxter stepped over, glanced at the names on the tabs.

"There are patient files here. Names: Richard... something, can't read the last name. Oh, Thomas. And Michael Franks."

"Why is this door unlocked?"

Baxter spun around, instinctively putting his phone back into his pocket.

Nancy stood in the doorway, purse still over her shoulder, eyes locked on him.

"Who are you?"

"I'm—IT support. Building management sent me to check—"

"This door is always locked." She stepped inside, let the door swing shut behind her. "Always. Who let you in here?"

"The receptionist. I needed to check the network connection and she said—"

"The temp?"

"I think so, yeah—"

Nancy moved past him, checked the desk, the files. Her hands moved quickly, closing folders, straightening papers. "You shouldn't be in here."

"I was just checking the router connection. There was a work order—"

She turned, looked at him directly. "From who?"

"Building management."

"We didn't call building management."

Baxter held up the clipboard. His hand shook slightly. "I'm just following the work order. I'll be done in two minutes and—"

"Get out."

"Excuse me?"

"Get. Out." Nancy pointed at the door. "Now."

"Go," Eddie said in his ear. "Don't push it."

Baxter nodded, backed toward the door. "Sorry for the confusion. I'll follow up with—"

"You do that." Nancy crossed her arms, blocking his path to the desk. "And next time, maybe call ahead."

"Right. Sorry."
