## Scene 15 — The Nail Salon

"Your work is beautiful. I saw a woman earlier this week with the most intricate design. French tips but with these little details along the sides?"

Kim smiled, filing Abby's nails with practiced efficiency. "Nancy. She comes in every two weeks like clockwork."

"She must love what you do."

"She loves how it looks." Kim examined Abby's cuticles, reached for the softener. "Pulls the 'we are neighbors' discount crap. Pays cash but what a bitch!"

Abby raised an eyebrow.

"Never tips, complains the entire time." Kim soaked Abby's fingertips in the bowl. "But she wants the best work, so..."

"She works at that clinic down the way, right? I think I saw her there."

"Head nurse or some shit. Acts like she owns the place."

"She must do well. Those nails aren't cheap."

Kim laughed, starting on Abby's other hand. "Girl, the nails are just the start. She's had work done." She gestured to her own face. "Lots of work. Botox, fillers, probably a lift. Maybe two."

"Good for her."

"Expensive, though. She's got money for that but not tipping." Kim rinsed Abby's hands, dried them carefully. "She comes in here, puts on her AirPods, talks to her friends the whole time. Gossip, mostly. Other people's sex lives."

"Sounds like entertainment."

"Usually." Kim started buffing. "Sometimes she has work calls."

"Work calls?" Abby perked up.

"First time, someone important. You could tell because she kept catching herself, looking around, rephrasing things. Something about a patient, how she can't—" Kim glanced toward the door, lowered her voice. "—discontinue someone on her own."

Abby kept her expression neutral.

"Second time was the pharmacy I think. She ripped into whoever answered." Kim shaped the nails with quick, precise movements. "I've never heard anyone yell at a pharmacist like that."

"Sounds intense."

"She's intense." Kim reached for the base coat. "Real piece of work. What's that show, with the bitchy women with bleached hair and boob jobs?"

"Real Housewives?"

"Yeah, she's that."

Abby's phone buzzed in her purse. Text from Baxter: *Got her financials. This is bad.*

"Color?" Kim held up the tray.

"Something neutral. You pick."

Kim selected a soft champagne, started applying the first coat with smooth, even strokes. "Nancy always goes bold. Reds, bright pinks. Lots of rhinestones."

"Of course she does."

Twenty minutes later, Abby stood at the register, handed Kim three twenties.

"Keep the change."

Kim's eyes widened. "That's—"

"You do beautiful work."

"Thank you."

"So Nancy? She ever talk about men."

"All the time. She's a real whore."

"Anyone regularly?"

"No. She goes them like—what's that thing you put trees into?"

"A wood chipper?"

"Yeah, that. She goes through men like a wood chipper."

"Intersting. I think I might know just the guy for her." she said with an evil grin.
