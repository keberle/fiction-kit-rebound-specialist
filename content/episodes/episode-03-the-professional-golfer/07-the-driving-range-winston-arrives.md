## Scene 7 — The Driving Range / Winston Arrives

"Just hold it lightly. Remember what Doogan said."

Marcus stood behind Brenda at the driving range, hands hovering near her grip. It was the morning of the best ball round of the Pro Am and Brenda was feeling some nerves. She adjusted. Re-adjusted. Looked at him.

"Do I have to keep saying 'effortless' out loud?"

"I think so?" he replied, shrugging.

Mara was leaning on her driver, watching patiently.

"Give her time. She's got tournament nerves right now."

"Waggle!"

"What?" Brenda looked back. "Doogan, I was wondering where you were."

"You and that movie."

"Better yet, let me introduce you to someone. Brenda Atwood this is Winston Reilly."

Winston stepped out from the background, an elderly black man wearing a golf polo, chinos and golf shoes, pulling an empty golf hand cart behind him.

"Hello, Winston."

"My wife loves you on that show.  The impressions are so funny."

"Aw, thank you!"

"So I have an idea. I'm worried Marcus trying to be the caddy you need might cut into his ability to manage your social media accounts."

"Oh, thank God!" Marcus exclaimed.

"Are you sure, I mean—" Brenda looked over at Marcus.

"It's more than okay. Welcome to the team, Winston!" Marcus shook Winston's hand.

"Okay, Winston. How do I fix this?"

Winston wasted no time.

"Where did you find Winston?"

"He was hustling skins games at a nearby nine hole muni course."

"And he's going to save Brenda's game?"

"Old guys like Winston have been playing for decades but they're not driving two-fifty off the tee anymore. Their bodies don't work like that. So they can't rely on mechanics."

"...not unlike Brenda."

"Exactly. Old guys like Winston are short game assassins. They'll lose two getting into green approach distance at least and make it up chipping and putting. Today is best ball so you've got that covered but tomorrow—"

"—is a scramble. She'll have to finish the holes herself."

"Following now?"

"Smart. Not just a pretty face, are you?"

"Is that a compliment?"

"Almost."

"I'll take it."

"How's an old guy in his late sixties going to carry her clubs?"

"That's why we brought the hand cart. Don't worry. I already checked the tournament rules."

"And I just go back and forth with the club?" Brenda asked.

"Yeah, just waggle it. It will nicely relax your arms and hands."

"I told you," Doogan said smugly.

"Yes you did." Mara groaned.
