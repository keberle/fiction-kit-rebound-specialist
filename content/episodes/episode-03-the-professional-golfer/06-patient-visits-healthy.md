## Scene 6 — Patient Visits (Healthy Pattern)

"So what we're really talking about here is aggressive growth. You want your money working, not sitting."

Phil Blakely rose, moved over to the window of his corner office, floor-to-ceiling glass, skyline below. Mid-forties, tailored suit, expensive watch.

Eddie nodded. "Sounds good."

"Risk tolerance." The broker turned, walked back. "How much volatility can you stomach?"

"A little."

"Don't be that guy."

"Pardon?"

"There are two types of investors, Eddie. Predators and prey."

"I mean—"

"The predators hunt for their dinner. No hunting and they starve."

"And the prey?"

"They are dinner. You know what a guy like me loves?"

Eddie glanced over at Phil's bookcase, Ironman Triathlon finish, accepting a local golf tournament trophy mixed in with the occasional overly posed family pic. "Outdoor sports?"

"Day traders."

"Day traders?"

"Yes. I love people tied to the internet, desperately hoping for some nugget of knowledge to get ahead of the market, ready to react in a moment."

"Aggressive and risk tolerant."

"Easy to manipulate. Look, put your money here at Keller-Watkins and we will manipulate them together. Buy before they know the opportunity exists, dump it before they realize they were tricked. Dance around the options market like we have a time machine."

"Sounds—"

"Profitable."

"Right."

The guy hadn't stopped moving. Typing, gesturing, pulling up charts.

Eddie's phone buzzed. He pulled it out. Abby.

"I need to take this."

"Sure." The broker waved at the door. "I'll pull up the paperwork."

Eddie stepped into the hallway, answered. "Hey."

Abby pulled onto the main road.

"I just left."

"How'd it go?"

"Sad."

"What happened?"

"The patient's dead. His mother answered the door."

"Jesus."

"Yeah. She invited me in. Showed me pictures."

"What'd you tell her?"

"That I was an old friend who'd lost touch. She didn't question it."

Eddie's voice: "What'd she say?"

"He'd been sick for a while. Cancer. Their insurance wasn't great. But she showed me this picture—him in Ireland, near the coast. He looked awful. Gaunt, hollow. But happy."

"Ireland?"

"He took her there before he died. To see where her grandparents were from. She kept saying how grateful she was for that trip."

Silence on the line.

"Eddie?"

"I'm here. Just—that's rough."

"What about yours?"

"Mine's not sick."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean he's not sick. At all. Guy's a finance bro. Kind of a douchebag but definitely not sick."

Abby frowned. "But he's on Baxter's list?"

"Yeah. High prescriptions, extensive medical records. But it doesn't add up."

"That doesn't make sense."

"Hold on." Eddie's voice muffled. Then: "Baxter's calling in."

Click.

Baxter's voice: "—can you both hear me?"

"Yeah," Abby said.

"I'm here," Eddie added.

"Okay, so I've been cross-referencing the lists. Abby, whose house were you at?"

"Richard Pemberton. Crossed off in blue pen on the shredded list."

"Right. And?"

"Deceased. Mother said he died three months ago."

"Jesus." Typing sounds. "Okay, so I'm looking at the clinic records right now. Richard Pemberton's file doesn't show deceased. It just... stops. Last entry was four months ago. A routine visit. Then nothing."

"No death certificate?" Abby asked.

"Not in their system. And there should be. Clinics are supposed to flag deceased patients."

Eddie's voice: "What about mine? Phil...something."

More typing. "Blakely. Shows... thirteen prescriptions in the last year. Pain killers, anti-anxiety, sleep aids. But no major diagnoses. Just a bunch of prescriptions without supporting medical records."

"There's no way that guy is dying, at least not from anything he sees coming."

"Then why is he on all this medication?" Baxter asked.

Silence.

"What if the crossed-out names are all dead?"

"Then why aren't they marked deceased in the system?" Baxter's voice, quiet now.

"And why do healthy people have pharmacy records that say they're dying?" Eddie added.

"This isn't adding up at all."
