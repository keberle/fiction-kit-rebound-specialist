## Scene 6 — Patient Visits (Healthy Pattern)

"So what we're really talking about here is aggressive growth. You want your money working, not sitting."

Phil Blakely rose, moved over to the window of his corner office, floor-to-ceiling glass, skyline below. Mid-forties, tailored suit, expensive watch.

Eddie nodded. "Sounds good."

"Risk tolerance." The broker turned, walked back. "How much volatility can you stomach?"

"A little."

"Don't be that guy."

"Pardon?"

"There are two types of investors, Eddie. predstors and prey."

"I mean—"

"The predators hunt for their dinner. No hunting and they starve."

"And the prey?"

"They are dinner. You know what a guy like me loves?"

Eddie scanned cabinet on the wall next to his desk.  Ironman triathlon finish shot, sail boat, golf tournament trophy, shots of the man with his trophy family. "Outdoor sports?"

"Day traders."

"Day traders?"

"Yes. I love people tied to the internet, desperately hoping for some nugget of knowledge to get ahead of the market, ready to react in a moment."

"Aggressive and risk tolerant."

"Easy to manipulate. Look, put your money here at Keller-Watkins and we will manipulate them together. Buy before they know the opportunity exists, dump it before they realize they were tricked. Dance around the options market like we have a time machine."

"Sounds—"

"Profitable."

"Right."

The guy hadn't stopped moving. Typing, gesturing, pulling up charts.

Eddie's phone buzzed. He pulled it out. Abby.

"I need to take this."

"Sure." The broker waved at the door. "I'll pull up the paperwork."

Eddie stepped into the hallway, answered. "Hey."

Abby had her bluetooth earpiece in and was pulling on to the main road from a small, suburban neighborhood.

"I just left."

"How'd it go?"

"Sad." She looked back into the rearview at the neighborhood. Small, older homes, chain link fences, small yards.

"What happened?"

"The patient's...dead. His mother answered the door."

"Jesus."

"Yeah." Abby reached her car, unlocked it, slid into the driver's seat. "She invited me in. Showed me pictures."

"What'd you tell her?"

"That I was an old friend who'd lost touch. She didn't question it."

Eddie's voice: "What'd she say?"

"He'd been sick for a while. Cancer, I think. Their insurance wasn't great." Abby started the engine, pulled away from the curb. "But she showed me this picture—him in Ireland, near the coast. He looked awful. Gaunt, hollow. But happy."

"Ireland?"

"He took her there before he died. To see where her grandparents were from. She kept saying how grateful she was for that trip."

Silence on the line.

"Eddie?"

"I'm here. Just—that's rough."

"What about yours?"

"Mine's not sick."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean he's not sick. At all. Guy's a finance bro. Investment advisor. Runs marathons. Does Crossfit at five AM. His doctor says he's got the bloodwork of a twenty-five-year-old."

Abby frowned. "But he's on Baxter's list?"

"Yeah. High prescriptions, extensive medical records. But it doesn't add up."

"That doesn't make sense."

"Hold on." Eddie's voice muffled. Then: "Baxter's calling in."

Click.

Baxter's voice: "—can you both hear me?"

"Yeah," Abby said.

"I'm here," Eddie added.

"Okay, so I've been cross-referencing the lists. Abby, whose house were you at?"

"Richard Pemberton. Crossed off in blue pen on the shredded list."

"Right. And?"

"Deceased. Mother said he died three months ago."

"Jesus." Typing sounds. "Okay, so I'm looking at the clinic records right now. Richard Pemberton's file doesn't show deceased. It just... stops. Last entry was four months ago. A routine visit. Then nothing."

"No death certificate?" Abby asked.

"Not in their system. And there should be. Clinics are supposed to flag deceased patients."

Eddie's voice: "What about mine? Phil...something." Eddie's car door closing abruptly.

More typing. "Blakely. Shows... thirteen prescriptions in the last year. Blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes medication, anti-anxiety, sleep aids. But no major diagnoses. Just a bunch of prescriptions without supporting medical records."

"There's no way that guy is dying, at least not from anything he see's coming."

"Then why is he on all this medication?" Baxter asked.

Silence.

Abby turned onto the main road. "What if the crossed-out names are all dead?"

"Then why aren't they marked deceased in the system?" Baxter's voice, quiet now.

"And why do healthy people have pharmacy records that say they're dying?" Eddie added.

"This isn't adding up at all."
