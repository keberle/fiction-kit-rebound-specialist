## Scene 3 — Welcome Gala & Auction

"—come on, John.  If you'll go to fifteen, I'll see if I can get you an hour driving the ball return cart on the range while Candy is warming up." Harry Halligan said to a captive audience chuckled along.

A paddle went up from the table of evening gowns and tuxedos.

"Fifteen!  There it is.  Connie!  Where are you, Connie?"

"Too rich for me." mouthed a red chanel gown.

"Then fifteen has it, folks! The drink cart for Wednesday's best ball tournament will be manned by our own and only John Malcolm. The cart girls will make sure you don't get lost, John."

Applause broke out. Hollywood and LPGA royalty represented, well dressed and well served.

Applause broke out. A who's who of Southern California hollywood and LPGA royalty, all dressed to the nines and well lubricated.

Doogan spotted Mara sitting at a table with two members of a hit tv show and their spouses along with her manager Jake and a few people he didn't recognize. Attractive and elegant, Mara was making small talk and easy to spot.

"OK, before we get to the next lot, its time again to upgrade the booze."

Laughter and applause broke out again as an attractive blonde girl, wearing a dress slit entirely too far up one side walked out with two bottles of champagne and a grin that everyone noticed.  Doogan glanced over to see Mara roll her eyes.

"Ah, giving our lovely assistants a break is tour leader, Candy Williams." Harry said bowing to let Candy take center stage. "And I think its safe to assume that the winning bid for this alcohol upgrade will be delivered to your table by the lovely Candy?"

"Absolutely." she leaned over to say into the microphone.

Applause and a lot of men fumbling to find their paddles.

"Ladies and gentleman, the champagne at your tables is mediocre on purpose.  This lovely pair of Dom Perignon upgrades can be yours for your table for a starting price of...five-hundred dollars."

A paddle immediately went up.

Mara excused herself from her table and headed over to the bar.  Doogan made his move.

"Can I buy the lady a drink?"

"Just sparkling water. This is a work week for me. And its a hosted bar."

"I was kind of hoping you'd maybe missed that last detail."

"Quite the gentleman."

"Seven fifty.  Do I hear seven fifty?" Harry continued.

"Whenever possible. Name's Doogan."

"Mara. But you knew that, I think."

"What gave it away?"

"Your left hand is slightly tanner than your right."

Doogan looked his right hand. The golf glove. "Gotcha."

"One thousand. Come on, Mark. You know your table would love the champagne upgrade."

"Is this where you tell me you're just a big fan of women's professional golf."

"Hardly."

She looked at him puzzled and took a sip of her sparkling wate. The ice sloshed back into the glass.

"I'm a big fan of women in STEM. Golf is just a nice bonus."

"Women in STEM?" she chuckled.

"Well, I'm a big fan of women."

"One thousand for the champagne upgrade to the Neilsen table."

"Now that I believe. I should get back to my table. It was nice to meet you, Doogan."

"It was nice to meet you, Mara."

She returned to her seat careful to avoid Candy carrying out her champagne delivery to the Nielsen table.

"Next up we have a...open caddy spot?" Harry said looking confused. "Got it." after a brief whisper from a female assistant. "It turns out that our own Mara Palani is without a caddy this week. Winner will have the honor of carrying Mara's bags for the three days of tournament play.

Applause broke out.

"Don't even think about it, John. I've seen you play. You're not even qualified to carry your own clubs." Laughter rippled across the room.

"We'll start at one thousand."

Three paddles up immediately.

"Fifteen hundred?"

Two paddles with one belonging to a husband with a confused wife looking at him.

"Two thousand?"

Priscila Chan, seated at a table with husband Mark Zuckerberg raised her paddle.

"Twenty-five hundred?"

The woman hesitated. Lowered her paddle.

Doogan raised his.

"New bidder in the back! Twenty-five hundred. Do I hear three thousand?"

Priscilla's paddle shot up.

"Three thousand! Do we have thirty-five hundred?"

Priscilla looked away. Mark Zuckerberg's paddle went up.

"Four thousand?

Doogan looked over at the Zuckerberg table and at Priscilla and gave an almost pleading head nod.

Priscilla made an inviting hand gesture, surrendering to Doogan.

Doogan raised his paddle.

"Four-thousand going once... twice..." The Harry paused. "Sold! Paddle sixty-three."

A tournament coordinator materialized. Expensive suit, clipboard. "Congratulations, Mr Andres?"

"Andrews. Doogan Andrews."

"Right. You'll get the details when you settle up at the front desk."

"Thank you."

"Next up, we have a golf bag autographed an amazing woman who has come out of retirement just for this event, Michelle Wie West. Don't worry, John. You might be qualified to carry this one." Laughter.

Mara got up from her table, make eye contact with Doogan and made her way to the bar. Doogan took the hint.

"We'll start the biddin at one-thousand dollars."

"Four thousand dollars to carry my clubs?"

"Seemed like a bargain."

"Have you caddied before?"

"No, but I've seen Tin Cup. Does that count."

"You're not going to tell me the golf swing is like a poem, are you?"

"I think it plays better on the driving range but if you insist..."

She laughed and held up her hand. "I think we're good."

"I can hand you the club you ask for and a bottle of water when you want it. I'm guessing that's about as much as you need."

"Ms. Palani?" An assistant appeared. "Your pairing this week is Brenda Atwood."

"Who?"

"She's on Studio 60? The sketch comedy show?"

Mara looked blank.

"She does Cher impressions?"

"Does she play golf?"

"I can check—"

"Never mind. Thanks."

"Could be worse, right?" Doogan added. "You could be paired with blondie over there."

Mara glanced over at Candy, "no because she's a pro...kind of." And gave a coy smile.

"Ouch. But fair."

"Its late for me so I'm going to head back to my hotel. And I guess we'll see if you can do more than quote Kevin Costner on the tee box Wednesday morning.  Have a nice evening."

"You too, Mara. And I'm looking forward to it."

She glanced back one last time and smiled at Doogan.

"Well, you stayed on budget at least." Jake appeared, drink in hand.

"Yeah, I got lucky on that one. Bidding against billionaires can get ugly fast."

"That couple is matching all the funds being raised here this week so I think they feel like their tax deduction is covered."

"Next up, for you movie fans, we have a Bushwood Estates caddy vest used in the movie, donated by Michael Richie himself," Harry started in on the next item.

"So what's your approach?"

"With Mara? With the weather we've had lately, She'll want to play into the wind on five and fourteen but I think she knows that better than I do. She's a professional."

"I mean for charming her or whatever it is that I've hired you to do."

"Don't worry.  I'm a professional too, Jake."
