## Scene 3 — Welcome Gala & Auction

"—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen, I'll see if I can get you an hour driving the ball return cart while Candy's warming up." Harry Halligan said it to a captive audience. Chuckled along.

Paddle up from the table of evening gowns and tuxedos.

"Fifteen! There it is. Connie! Where are you, Connie?"

"Too rich for me." Red Chanel gown mouthed it.

"Then fifteen has it! The drink cart for Wednesday's Best Ball will be manned by our own John Malcolm. The cart girls will make sure you don't get lost, John."

Applause broke out. Southern California Hollywood and LPGA royalty dressed to the nines.

Doogan spotted Mara at a table with two members from a hit show, their spouses, her manager Jake, and a few others he didn't recognize.

"Okay, before we get to the next lot, it's time to upgrade the booze."

Laughter and applause as an attractive blonde walked out with two champagne bottles. Dress slit far up one side. Grin that everyone noticed. Doogan glanced over—Mara rolled her eyes.

"Giving our lovely assistants a break is tour leader Candy Williams." Harry bowed, let Candy take center stage. "Safe to assume the winning bid will be delivered to your table by the lovely Candy?"

"Absolutely." She leaned into the microphone.

Applause. Men fumbling for paddles.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the champagne at your tables is mediocre on purpose. This lovely pair of Dom Pérignon can be yours for a starting price of... five hundred dollars."

Paddle went up immediately.

Mara excused herself, headed to the bar. Doogan made his move.

"Can I buy the lady a drink?"

"Just sparkling water. Work week for me. And it's a hosted bar."

"I was hoping you'd maybe miss that last detail."

"Quite the gentleman."

"Seven fifty. Do I hear seven fifty?" Harry continued.

"Whenever possible. Name's Doogan."

"Mara. But you knew that."

"What gave it away?"

"Your left hand's tanner than your right."

Doogan looked at his right hand. Golf glove. "Gotcha."

"One thousand. Come on, Mark. You know your table would love the champagne."

"Is this where you tell me you're a big fan of women's professional golf?"

"Hardly."

She looked at him, puzzled. Took a sip of sparkling water. Ice sloshed.

"I'm a big fan of women in STEM. Golf's a nice bonus."

"Women in STEM?" She chuckled.

"Well, I'm a big fan of women."

"One thousand for the champagne to the Nielsen table."

"Now that I believe. I should get back. Nice to meet you, Doogan."

"Nice to meet you, Mara."

She returned to her seat, avoided Candy carrying champagne to the Nielsen table.

"Next up we have a... open caddy spot?" Harry looked confused. "Got it." Brief whisper from an assistant. "Turns out our own Mara Palani is without a caddy this week. Winner will carry Mara's bags for three days of tournament play."

Applause broke out.

"Don't even think about it, John. I've seen you play. You're not qualified to carry your own clubs." Laughter.

"We'll start at one thousand."

Three paddles up.

"Fifteen hundred?"

Two paddles. One belonging to a husband with confused wife looking at him.

"Two thousand?"

Priscilla Chan, seated with husband Mark Zuckerberg, raised her paddle.

"Twenty-five hundred?"

She hesitated. Lowered it.

Doogan raised his.

"New bidder in the back! Twenty-five hundred. Do I hear three thousand?"

Priscilla's paddle shot up.

"Three thousand! Do we have thirty-five hundred?"

Priscilla looked away. Mark Zuckerberg's paddle went up.

"Four thousand?"

Doogan looked over, gave Priscilla an almost pleading nod.

Priscilla made an inviting gesture, surrendering.

Doogan raised his paddle.

"Four thousand going once... twice..." Harry paused. "Sold! Paddle sixty-three."

Tournament coordinator materialized. Expensive suit, clipboard. "Congratulations, Mr. Andres?"

"Andrews. Doogan Andrews."

"Right. You'll get details when you settle up at the front desk."

"Thank you."

"Next up, a golf bag autographed by an amazing woman who came out of retirement for this event, Michelle Wie West. Don't worry, John. You might be qualified to carry this one." Laughter.

Mara got up, made eye contact with Doogan, headed to the bar. Doogan took the hint.

"We'll start the bidding at one thousand dollars."

"Four thousand dollars to carry my clubs?"

"Seemed like a bargain."

"Have you caddied before?"

"No, but I've seen Tin Cup. Does that count?"

"You're not going to tell me the golf swing's like a poem, are you?"

"I think it plays better on the driving range, but if you insist..."

She laughed. Held up her hand. "I think we're good."

"I can hand you the club you ask for and a bottle of water when you want it. I'm guessing that's about as much as you need."

"Ms. Palani?" Assistant appeared. "Your pairing this week is Brenda Atwood."

"Who?"

"She's on Studio 60? The sketch comedy show?"

Mara looked blank.

"She does Cher impressions?"

"Does she play golf?"

"I can check—"

"Never mind. Thanks."

"Could be worse, right?" Doogan added. "You could be paired with blondie over there."

Mara glanced at Candy. "No, because she's a pro... kind of." Coy smile.

"Ouch. But fair."

"It's late for me so I'm heading back to my hotel. I guess we'll see if you can do more than quote Kevin Costner on the tee box Wednesday morning. Have a nice evening."

"You too. Looking forward to it."

She glanced back. Smiled at Doogan.

"Well, you stayed on budget." Jake appeared, drink in hand.

"Yeah, got lucky. Bidding against billionaires can get ugly fast."

"That couple's matching all the funds raised this week. They probably feel their tax deduction's covered."

"Next up, for you movie fans, a Bushwood Estates caddy vest used in the film, donated by Michael Ritchie himself," Harry started on the next item.

"So what's your approach?"

"With Mara? With the weather we've had, she'll want to play into the wind on five and fourteen. But she knows that better than I do. She's a professional."

"I mean for charming her or whatever it is I've hired you to do."

"Don't worry. I'm a professional too, Jake."
