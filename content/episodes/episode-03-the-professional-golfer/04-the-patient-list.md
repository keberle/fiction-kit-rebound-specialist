## Scene 4 — The Patient List

"—three thousand dollars, Eddie. Jake paid three thousand dollars for him to carry golf clubs."

Doogan heard Abby's voice through the front door.

"Four thousand." Eddie didn't look up from his phone.

"What?"

"It was four thousand."

Doogan entered through the unlocked front door.

Eddie spotted him. "There he is! The big spender."

Abby appeared from the kitchen, wine glass in hand. "How much did you actually spend? That we now have to bill Jake?"

"Three or four thousand. Something like that."

"Something like that?" Eddie laughed. "You don't remember?"

"I was focused on Mara."

"Of course you were." Abby crossed to the living room where Baxter's face filled the monitor on the coffee table. "Jake could've just introduced you. Would've been cheaper."

"Wouldn't have been believable."

"Oh, so you're method acting now?"

"It's called—"

"It's called spending three...or four grand we don't need to spend." Abby sipped her wine, gestured at the screen. "Baxter's been waiting."

Doogan moved to the couch. "Hey, Baxter."

"Hey. How was—"

"He won," Eddie cut in. "Obviously. Because when Doogan commits, he commits. Goes all in. Which is why we're now three thousand dollars lighter and—"

"Can we focus?" Baxter's voice cracked through. "I've got the patient data."

"Right." Eddie dropped onto the couch. "What've we got?"

"Before the clinic scrubbed their files, I exported what I could. Names, addresses, some dates. But no diagnoses. No treatment notes. No billing codes."

Abby set her wine down. "How many patients?"

"Forty-three."

"That's a lot," Eddie said.

"It's not just a lot." Baxter's screen shifted, showed a spreadsheet. "Twenty of them had prescriptions filled. Lots of prescriptions. More than you'd expect for—"

"For what?" Abby leaned closer.

"For healthy people. Alice Chen—forty-eight. Fifteen prescriptions in one year. All expensive. But before this clinic? No indication I can find that she was sick."

"You're saying that's a lot for a healthy person?"

"I'm saying that from what I could google about these prescriptions, I would be surprised if she can even make it into the clinic unassisted."

Abby pulled the folded patient list from her purse. "I've got twenty-three names from the shredder. Several are crossed off."

"Crossed off how?" Eddie sat forward.

She unfolded it, showed the camera. "Blue pen. Eight names. Like someone checking off—"

"Crossed off?" Doogan asked. "Like... deceased?"

"No, they're not marked deceased in the patient summaries. No insurance or billing so I can't be sure but usually clinics track that." Baxter added.

"So why are they crossed out?"

"Can you read the names?" Baxter asked.

"They're not crossed out for privacy," Abby added. "It's like it was some checklist."

Baxter typed. Waited. "Okay. So those eight crossed-off names? None of them show up in pharmacy records."

"None?" Doogan asked.

"Zero prescriptions. Which is weird, right? You go to a clinic, you get prescriptions. That's how clinics work."

"Clinics don't also have just one exam room that's off camera that only one nurse uses."

Doogan spoke. "There's a secret exam room?"

"Exam Room 1. End of the hall."

"No cameras?"

"Not even in the hallway. Only room with zero coverage. And it looks like only one nurse uses it."

"That's intentional," Doogan said.

Eddie looked at him. "What are you thinking?"

"You're running a clinic. Cameras everywhere for liability. Except one room. Why?"

"Because you don't want people seeing what happens in that room," Abby said.

Baxter nodded on screen. "I can try to dig into her patient assignments, but most of that data's gone. All I know is she's the head nurse and extremely—"

"Territorial," Abby finished. "She practically searched me. Tons of work done. Fake rack for sure. Oh, and her nails? French tips. Professional job. Expensive."

"You noticed her nails?" Eddie asked.

"I notice everything."

"That's not normal."

"Says the man who color-coordinates his golf shirts by season."

"That's style, babe."

"That's narcissism."

Doogan cut through. "Two lists. Abby's shredded paper with crossed-off names. Baxter's pharmacy data with the over-prescribed patients."

"Divide and conquer," Eddie said.

"I'll take the crossed-off names." Abby picked up her wine. "Those must be the ones someone is hiding, someone will talk."

"And I'll visit the over-prescribed patients," Eddie said. "Find out why healthy people are suddenly medicating like—"

"What about me?" Baxter asked.

"Nancy," Doogan said. "Background. Finances. Anything that explains the private exam room."

Abby looked at Doogan. "And you're doing what?"

"Golf. Fun day tomorrow. I will get to see what kind of hand I've been dealt."

Eddie laughed. "Of course."

"It's work."

"Four thousand dollars' worth of work." Eddie stretched. "With a gorgeous professional athlete. Jake's getting his money's worth."

"I thought it was three thousand" Abby countered.

"Three or four thousand, but it was so long ago."

"It was an hour ago," Eddie replied.

Abby raised her glass. "To Doogan's sacrifice."
