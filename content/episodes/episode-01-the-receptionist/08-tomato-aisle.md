## Scene 8 — Tomato Aisle

"-I know, I know...but he wants a status update."

Doogan turned a Roma tomato over in his hand, pretending to examine it. "We just accepted the job.  What's his hurry?  Tell him I'm meeting her tonight. I'll call you after." He kept his voice low. Through the produce section's windows, he'd spotted her—office attire, professional but not stuffy. Monday evening dinner run, just like Baxter predicted.

"Doogan, he's going to want specifics—"

"Eddie. I gotta go."

He tapped the earpiece off. Annabelle Anders. Right on schedule.

Doogan dropped the tomato into his basket and repositioned himself where she'd surely see him. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead. The produce section smelled like misted lettuce and cardboard. In his ear, Baxter's voice replaced Eddie's silence.

"She's early. Her usual time is six-fifteen, but it's only—oh. You already see her."

Doogan didn't respond. She was working her way through the entrance, grabbing a basket, glancing at her phone.

"Want me to mute?"

"Uh huh." Under his breath.

"Got it. I'm here if you need me."

He picked up another tomato. Gave it serious consideration. The kind of consideration that says *I'm a man who takes produce seriously and definitely didn't plan this encounter*.

"You again."

Doogan looked up. She was three feet away, basket in hand, smile uncertain but warm.

"Me again." He held up the tomato. "You have an opinion on Romas versus heirloom?"

"Still shopping for tomatoes, I see." Her tone was lighter than Saturday. Almost playful. "This is becoming a pattern."

"I heard they had good tomatoes here." He set the tomato down, deadpan. "Turns out the rumors were true."

She laughed. "You came to this specific grocery store because someone said they had good tomatoes?"

"You don't?"

"No. Normal people do not do that."

"Your loss." He selected another heirloom, examining it with exaggerated seriousness. "So. Tomatoes. Monday night shopping?"

"Dinner run on the way home from work." She gestured at her basket. "The exciting life of a receptionist.  Just shopping for tomatoes tonight?"

"Among other things. You?"

She held up her basket. Doogan could see the contents clearly—a stack of trendy premade meals, the kind with minimalist packaging and maximum markup. The sort of thing a wellness influencer would endorse.

"Very healthy," Doogan said. "Very... photogenic."

"They're convenient."

"They're also terrible."

"Excuse me?"

"They're not *food*. They're content. Designed to look good on Instagram, not taste good on a Monday."

She crossed her arms, but she was still smiling. "And you're some kind of food snob?"

"I'm a realist. Those containers are going to taste like plastic and disappointment."

"You don't know that."

"What's your favorite restaurant?"

The pivot caught her off guard. "What?"

"Restaurant. Favorite. Go."

"I—Providence, I guess. But I haven't been in—"

In his ear, Baxter's voice cut in: "Providence is known for their risotto according to this Yelp review—shrimp, I guess—and it's all over their social media."

"And at Providence, what do you order?"

"The tasting menu, usually."

"But if you weren't doing the tasting menu. If you walked in and ordered one thing."

She considered. "Hmmm...not sure..."

"Shrimp risotto?  Probably with a sweet white wine - a Riesling maybe."

Her eyes went wide. "How did you—" She stopped. Stared at him. "Okay, that's either really impressive or really creepy."

"I prefer mysterious."

She laughed, actual and unguarded. "You're definitely that."

"I'm glad you noticed."

"You know," Doogan said, turning back to the tomatoes, "this place has everything you need for a real risotto. Arborio rice, shallots, decent parmesan." He selected three more tomatoes. "Even the shrimp's not terrible, if you know what to look for."

"Are you suggesting something?"

"I'm buying groceries. What you do with that information is up to you."

Doogan moved past her toward the rice aisle. She didn't follow immediately—he could feel her watching him go, calculating.

Good.

Ten minutes later, Doogan was in the checkout line with a basket full of risotto ingredients when she appeared behind him.

"You really think you can make it better than Providence?"

"I think I can make it better than whatever's in that container."

She glanced at her basket. The premade meals looked even sadder under the fluorescent lights.

"The shallots here aren't great," she said.

"I'll make do."

"And the parmesan is pre-grated."

"Criminal, but survivable."

They were both checked out now, standing in the no-man's-land between the registers and the exit. She bit her lower lip.

"I don't usually invite strange men from grocery stores to cook for me."

"I'm not strange. I'm unconventional. There's a difference."

In his ear, Baxter's voice: "She's not going to—"

"Fine." She looked at him directly, decision made.

Baxter went silent.

"Fine?" Doogan said.

"You can cook. I'll provide the kitchen and the judgment."

"That's all I ask."

They walked out into the early evening light, a gust from the late fall breeze. She pointed across the street to a modern low-rise with that particular LA blend of glass and concrete.

"It's right there. Building with the blue awning."

"Convenient."

"That's why I shop here." She paused at the crosswalk. "Fair warning—I have minimal cooking utensils."

"Risotto needs a pan and a spoon. You have those?"

"Probably."

"Then we're in business."

The light changed. They crossed together.

In his ear, Baxter's voice: "This doesn't work for anyone else, you know that, right?"

Doogan tapped the earpiece once. Enough audience for tonight.
