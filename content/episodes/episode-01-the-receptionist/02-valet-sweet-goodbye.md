## Scene 2 — Valet (Sweet Goodbye)

The night air was warm as they stepped outside toward the valet station. Claire walked close enough that their shoulders almost touched. Old habit.

"This was nice," she said. "Is that a weird thing to say about your own breakup dinner?"

"Depends. Are you grading on a curve?"

"I'm a lawyer. I don't do curves."

"And yet you curved me."

She stopped at the corner of the building, turning to face him. "I didn't curve you. I'm releasing you back into the wild."

"Like a rehabilitated sea turtle."

"Exactly like that. A sea turtle who's very good at eye contact and terrible at long-term commitment."

"I feel like we're mixing metaphors now."

"You started it."

The valet stand glowed twenty feet ahead. A kid in a red vest was handing keys to an older couple. Beyond them, a younger pair stood rigid—the woman's arms crossed, the man's hands jammed in his pockets.

"Thank you," Claire said. "I mean it. For everything."

"You don't have to—"

"I know I don't. That's why I'm saying it." She squeezed his arm once. "Take care of yourself, Doogan. Try not to break any hearts."

"No promises."

She smiled and handed her ticket to the valet ahead of him.

A silver BMW sedan rolled up first. Doogan tipped the kid before he could move and opened her door.

"Of course you did." She slid behind the wheel. "Goodbye, Doogan."

"Drive safe, Counselor."

She pulled away. Taillights vanished into traffic.

Doogan told himself it was fine. It was always fine.

The young couple near the valet had escalated. The woman—mid-twenties, dark curly hair, fury radiating off her in waves—jabbed a finger at the man's chest.

"You said you were working late. Working. Late."

"Babe, I can explain—"

"Don't 'babe' me. Not after—" She stopped, noticed Doogan standing there. "What are you looking at?"

"Sorry. Just waiting for my car."

"Great. Enjoy your car." She turned back to her boyfriend. "We're done."

She stormed off toward the street. The guy stood frozen, watching her go.

Doogan handed his ticket to the valet and stepped closer. "Hey."

He barely registered Doogan. "What?"

"The trick is knowing when to follow and when not to follow." Doogan nodded toward her retreating figure. "This is a follow-her moment."

"She said we're done."

"She said that standing ten feet from you instead of getting in an uber." He shrugged. "Go."

His jaw tightened. He took off running, calling her name. She stopped. Turned. Doogan couldn't hear what he said, but her arms uncrossed.

The Cougar rumbled up to the curb like a promise someone forgot to keep. Faded dark blue paint, patched soft top, an engine note that suggested mechanical stubbornness more than reliability.

The valet handed Doogan the keys with barely concealed judgment. "Nice car."

"She has a good personality."

Doogan tipped him anyway and slid behind the wheel. The leather was warm from sitting. He put the top down—why not—and was reaching for the ignition when his earpiece buzzed.

Eddie's voice came through. "How'd it go?"

"She dumped me with grace and poise. Said I helped her believe in herself again."

"Beautiful. Clean exit?"

"Clean as it gets."

"Perfect.  I'll let her sister know and send her our final bill.  She doesn't suspect, does she?"

"No, she doesn't suspect. I'm a professional for a reason." Doogan said, almost reluctantly.

"That's my boy.  So listen, got a couple things for you."

"Eddie."

"Just hear me out. First one's easy. Marketing executive, early thirties, just got dumped by her fiancé. Her best friend hired us. She's worried she's going to do something stupid."

"Define stupid."

"Quit her job and move back to Ohio."

"That might be stupid."

"Right? The friend says she's spiraling—won't leave her apartment, keeps texting the ex, the whole disaster package. She just needs someone to remind her she's desirable before she blows up her whole life."

"Pass."

"Come on. Classic rebound case. Quick in, quick out, help her remember she's worth more than some finance bro who couldn't commit."

"Let her friends handle it."

"Her friends tried. That's why they're calling us." Eddie paused. "She's got the money, Doogan. And the friend's desperate."

"Still pass."

"Fine. Second one's trickier. Actress—you've seen her, that streaming thing about the lawyers—"

"Pass."

"You didn't even let me finish."

"I don't need to. Actresses come with publicists, and publicists come with complications."

"The publicist is who's paying."

"Even worse."

A pause. Eddie recalibrating. "Okay. Look, there's a third one, but we should talk about it in person."

"What's the pitch?"

"Come over—I'm ordering Thai. We'll eat, we'll talk, you can decide if it's worth your time."

Doogan stopped at a red light. The Cougar idled rough, threatening to stall.

"You bribing me with Thai food now?"

"Is it working?"

The light turned green. He gave the engine gas and it caught, rumbling forward.

"Yeah. It's working."

"Good. See you in twenty." The call clicked off.

The Cougar rumbled through the night. Warm air. City lights.

He turned up the radio and tried not to think about Claire.
