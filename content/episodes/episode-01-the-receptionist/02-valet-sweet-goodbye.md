## Scene 2 — Valet (Sweet Goodbye)

The night air was warm with the Santa Ana wind. Claire walked close enough that their shoulders almost touched.

"This was nice," she said. "Is that a weird thing to say about your own breakup dinner?"

"Depends. How nice?"

"Nice enough that I'm regretting not letting you cook for me."

"The night is still young."

"And we both know that I'll lose my nerve if that happens. You made these last few weeks feel like exactly what I needed."

"I'm happy for you, sad for your nerve"

"You'll live." She smiled. "I'm releasing you back into the wild, Doogan. Try not to break too many hearts."

"Like a rehabilitated sea turtle."

"Sure. A sea turtle who's suspiciously good at knowing exactly what to say."

"I feel like we're mixing metaphors now."

"You started it with the turtle."

The valet stand glowed twenty feet ahead. An older couple was collecting their keys. Beyond them, a younger pair stood rigid—the woman's arms crossed, the man's hands jammed in his pockets.

"Thank you," Claire said. "I mean it. For everything."

"You don't have to—"

"I know I don't. That's why I'm saying it." She squeezed his arm once. "Take care of yourself, Doogan. Try not to break any hearts."

"I'll just be alone in my condo, cooking for one."

"Uh huh..." She smiled, rolled her eyes sarcastically and handed her ticket to the valet ahead of him.

A silver BMW sedan rolled up first. Doogan tipped the kid before he could move and opened her door.

She slid behind the wheel.  The weight of the moment had just caught her, "Goodbye, Doogan."

"Drive safe, Counselor."

She pulled away. Taillights vanished into traffic.

Doogan told himself it was fine. It was always fine.

The young couple near the valet had escalated. The woman—mid-twenties, dark curly hair, fury radiating off her in waves—jabbed a finger at the man's chest.

"You said you were working late. Working. Late."

"Babe, I can explain—"

"Don't 'babe' me. Not after—" She stopped, noticed Doogan standing there. "What are you looking at?"

"Sorry. Just waiting for my car."

"Great. Enjoy your car." She snapped before turning back to her boyfriend. "We're done."

She stormed off toward the street. The guy stood frozen, watching her go.

Doogan handed his ticket to the valet and stepped closer. "Hey."

He barely registered Doogan. "What?"

"The trick is knowing when to follow and when not to follow." Doogan nodded toward her retreating figure. "This is a follow-her moment."

"She said we're done."

"She said that standing ten feet from you instead of getting in an uber." He shrugged. "Go."

His jaw tightened. He took off running, calling her name. She stopped. Turned. Doogan couldn't hear what he said, but her arms uncrossed.

The Cougar rumbled up to the curb. Faded dark blue paint, top down, an engine note that suggested mechanical stubbornness more than reliability.

The valet handed Doogan the keys with barely concealed judgment. "Nice car."

"She has a good personality."

Doogan tipped him and slid behind the wheel. The leather was warm from sitting in the southern california evening air. He was just pulling away from the valet area when his earpiece buzzed.

Eddie's voice came through. "How'd it go?"

"She dumped me with grace and poise."

"Beautiful. Clean exit?"

"Clean as it gets."

"Perfect. I'll let her sister know and send her our final bill." A pause. "Oh, Abby's asking how much dinner was so we can add it to the final expenses."

"This one's on me."

"Doogan—"

"On me, Eddie."

A beat of silence. Then: "You're doing it again."

"Doing what?"

"Getting too close. That's the whole point of having a business model—you don't pay for your own work."

"Consider it a tip for good behavior."

"That's not how tips work." Eddie sighed. "Fine. Your funeral. So listen, got something for you. Marketing executive, early thirties, just got dumped by her fiancé. Her best friend hired us."

"Pass."

"Come on. Classic rebound case." Eddie paused. "She's got the money, Doogan. And the friend's desperate."

"Still pass."

"Fine.  Next up, an actress-"

"Pass.  Hard pass."

"There's real money here, buddy. And this won't be like the last one-"

"Yes it will.  Pass."

"Fine. There's a third one, but we should talk about it in person."

"What's the pitch?"

"Come over—I'm ordering Thai. We'll eat, we'll talk, you can decide if it's worth your time."

Doogan stopped at a red light. The Cougar idled rough, threatening to stall.

"You bribing me with Thai food now? I just ate dinner."

"I'm bribing you with a late night snack and the company of friends. Is it working?"

The light turned green. He gave the engine gas and it caught, rumbling forward.

"Yeah. It's working."

"Good. See you in twenty." The call clicked off.

The Cougar rumbled through the night. Warm air. City lights.

He turned up the radio and tried not to think about Claire.
