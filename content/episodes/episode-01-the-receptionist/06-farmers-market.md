## Scene 6 — Farmer's Market

The poodle found him before he found her.

Doogan was browsing heirloom tomatoes or pretending to, since the vendor had been eyeing him for a full minute when a white ball of fluff appeared at his ankles, nose working overtime.

"Hey there." He crouched down, one hand scratching behind her ears while the other slipped into his pocket. The bacon from Sebastian's plate, fed while he kept his eyes on the approaching owner.

Coco devoured the evidence and immediately decided he was her new favorite person.

"Coco! Oh my god—" A woman rushed over. Late twenties, dark hair pulled back, Stanford hoodie over yoga pants. "I'm so sorry. She got away from me."

"No harm done." He gave Coco one last scratch and stood. The dog sat at his feet, tail sweeping the pavement, clearly not planning to leave. "She's friendly."

"She's a menace." Annabelle grabbed the leash, but Coco wasn't budging. "Come on. Let's go."

Coco looked up at him. Looked at Annabelle. Stayed exactly where she was.

"She doesn't seem to agree."

"She never agrees. That's the problem." Annabelle tugged again. Nothing. "Seriously?"

"Maybe she likes tomatoes."

"She hates tomatoes. She hates most vegetables. She's very particular." Annabelle gave him a look—half exasperation, half curiosity. "You must just have one of those faces."

"That only a cute poodle could love?"

She laughed.  That was not what she was thinking.

"Sorry. She's usually better behaved. Or at least better at pretending to be behaved."

"Aren't we all?" He stepped back from the tomato stand, and Coco finally followed—but only because he was moving. "She's got good taste, though. These are the best tomatoes in the market."

"You an expert?"

"I'm a man who takes produce seriously."

"That's either very impressive or very concerning."

"Depends on the day."

Annabelle smiled. Coco was still pressed against his leg.

"I'm Annabelle."

"Doogan."

"That's unusual."

"Family name. My mother veto'd about six names before my father relented and gave in on this one."

"Your mother sounds like a character."

"She prefers 'Southern.'" He glanced down at Coco. "You come here often? The market, I mean. Not the tomato stand specifically."

"Every Saturday. Coco likes the attention, and I like the coffee vendor." She gestured vaguely toward the other end of the market. "There's a guy who does these little hearts in the foam, and they're very..."

"Instagram worthy?"

She chuckled, self consciously "You don't like foam designs?"

"I'm more of a 'drink it before it gets cold' person."

"A purist."

"A realist. Foam art doesn't improve the taste."

"That's a controversial opinion for Southern California."

"I'm simple like that."

Coco had started sniffing toward the next stall—a cheese vendor—and Annabelle let herself be pulled along. The market smelled like fresh bread and overripe peaches. Doogan fell into step beside them. The movement felt natural.

"I have a feeling you're not that simple.  So what brings you to the farmer's market?" she asked. "Besides the tomatoes."

"Morning run. Needed to cool down, saw the signs, figured I'd browse."

"Find what you were hoping for?"

"Pleasantly surprised, actually." he said giving her a smile.

"Oh..." She was studying him now. "Most people just grab a smoothie and keep going."

"Most people don't appreciate a good tomato."

"Oh, right...the produce."

"I told you. I take produce seriously."

They reached the cheese vendor. Coco was straining toward a sample tray, and Annabelle scooped her up before she could cause an incident.

"She's going to expect this every week now," Annabelle said, settling the dog against her hip. "Running into handsome strangers who let her violate their personal space."

"Handsome?"

"I said what I said."

"I'll take it." Doogan picked up a wedge of aged cheddar, pretended to consider it. "Does she usually drag you into conversations with strangers?"

"Only the ones who don't run away fast enough."

"Noted."

Annabelle shifted Coco to her other arm. The dog watched Doogan with total devotion.

"I should probably rescue you," she said. "Before she decides you're her new owner."

"I don't mind."

"That's what they all say. Then she follows you home and suddenly you're buying organic dog food and apologizing to your neighbors."

"Voice of experience?"

"Bitter, hard-won experience.  She's a handful."

He set down the cheese. "An armful at least.  I should finish my run. Before my legs remember how far I've already gone."

"Very wise." She paused. "It was nice meeting you, Doogan. And sorry again about—" She gestured at Coco. "The ambush."

"Best ambush I've had all week."

"That's either flattering or your week has been very boring."

"Little of both."

Doogan turned toward the market exit, and Coco let out a small, betrayed whine.

"Traitor," Annabelle muttered at the dog.

He was halfway down the aisle when he heard her call out.

"Hey—Doogan?"

He turned.

"Same time next week?" She said it casually, like it didn't matter. Her face said otherwise. "Coco will be devastated if you don't show."

"Can't disappoint Coco."

"That's what I thought."

He gave her a small wave and kept walking, the morning sun warm on his face.

He didn't know her coffee order. Didn't know about this market. Didn't know about Coco.  Something felt off but she seemed sweet enough to proceed.
