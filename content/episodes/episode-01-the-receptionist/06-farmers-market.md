## Scene 6 — Farmer's Market

The poodle found him before he found her.

Doogan was browsing heirloom tomatoes—or pretending to, since the vendor had been eyeing him for a full minute—when a white ball of fluff appeared at his ankles, nose working overtime.

"Hey there." He crouched down, one hand scratching behind her ears while the other slipped into his pocket. The bacon from Sebastian's plate, fed discreetly while he kept his eyes on the approaching owner.

Coco devoured the evidence and immediately decided I was her new favorite person.

"Coco! Oh my god—" A woman rushed over, embarrassment already coloring her cheeks. Late twenties, dark hair pulled back, Stanford hoodie over yoga pants. "I'm so sorry. She got away from me."

"No harm done." He gave Coco one last scratch and stood. The dog sat at his feet, tail sweeping the pavement, clearly not planning to leave. "She's friendly."

"She's a menace." Annabelle grabbed the leash, but Coco wasn't budging. "Come on. Let's go."

Coco looked up at me. Looked at Annabelle. Stayed exactly where she was.

"She doesn't seem to agree."

"She never agrees. That's the problem." Annabelle tugged again. Nothing. "Seriously?"

"Maybe she likes tomatoes."

"She hates tomatoes. She hates most vegetables. She's very particular." Annabelle gave me a look—half exasperation, half curiosity. "You must just have one of those faces."

"That's what my mother always said. Right before she'd add 'and that's not a compliment.'"

She laughed. Surprised, genuine. The tension in her shoulders dropped.

"Sorry. She's usually better behaved. Or at least better at pretending to be behaved."

"Aren't we all?" I stepped back from the tomato stand, and Coco finally followed—but only because I was moving. "She's got good taste, though. These are the best heirlooms in the market."

"You an expert?"

"I'm a man who takes produce seriously."

"That's either very impressive or very concerning."

"Depends on the day."

Annabelle smiled. Not the polite kind—the real kind, the one that meant she'd decided he was worth talking to. Coco was still pressed against his leg, apparently convinced they were bonded for life.

"I'm Annabelle."

"Doogan."

"That's unusual."

"Family name. My grandfather's, supposedly. Though my mother also said she was heavily medicated during labor, so the paperwork might be suspect."

"Your mother sounds like a character."

"She prefers 'Southern.'" He glanced down at Coco. "You come here often? The market, I mean. Not the tomato stand specifically."

"Every Saturday. Coco likes the attention, and I like the coffee vendor." She gestured vaguely toward the other end of the market. "There's a guy who does these little hearts in the foam. Very instagrammable."

"I'm more of a 'drink it before it gets cold' person."

"A purist."

"A realist. Foam art doesn't improve the taste."

"That's a controversial opinion for Southern California."

"I contain multitudes."

Coco had started sniffing toward the next stall—a cheese vendor—and Annabelle let herself be pulled along. Doogan fell into step beside them without being asked. The movement felt natural. Easy.

"So what brings you to the farmer's market?" she asked. "Besides the tomatoes."

"Morning run. Needed to cool down, saw the signs, figured I'd browse."

"In running gear."

"I commit to my routines."

"Clearly." She was studying him now, not quite suspicious but definitely curious. "Most people just grab a smoothie and keep going."

"Most people don't appreciate a good heirloom."

"There you go with the tomatoes again."

"I told you. I take produce seriously."

We'd reached the cheese vendor. Coco was straining toward a sample tray, and Annabelle scooped her up before she could cause an incident.

"She's going to expect this every week now," Annabelle said, settling the dog against her hip. "Running into handsome strangers who let her violate their personal space."

"Handsome?"

"I said what I said."

"I'll take it." Doogan picked up a wedge of aged cheddar, pretended to consider it. "Does she usually drag you into conversations with strangers?"

"Only the ones who don't run away fast enough."

"Noted."

Annabelle shifted Coco to her other arm. The dog was watching Doogan with total devotion, which was mildly flattering and entirely bought with stolen bacon.

"I should probably rescue you," she said. "Before she decides you're her new owner."

"I don't mind."

"That's what they all say. Then she follows you home and suddenly you're buying organic dog food and apologizing to your neighbors."

"Voice of experience?"

"Bitter, hard-won experience."

He set down the cheese. "I should finish my run. Before my legs remember how far I've already gone."

"Very wise." She paused. "It was nice meeting you, Doogan. And sorry again about—" She gestured at Coco. "The ambush."

"Best ambush I've had all week."

"That's either flattering or your week has been very boring."

"Little of both."

Doogan turned toward the market exit, and Coco let out a small, betrayed whine.

"Traitor," Annabelle muttered at the dog.

He was halfway down the aisle when he heard her call out.

"Hey—Doogan?"

He turned.

"Same time next week?" She said it casually, like it didn't matter. Her face said otherwise. "Coco will be devastated if you don't show."

"Can't disappoint Coco."

"That's what I thought."

He gave her a small wave and kept walking, the morning sun warm on his face and Sebastian's lies already unraveling in his head.

He didn't know her coffee order. Didn't know about this market. Didn't know about Coco.

Whatever story he'd sold them, Annabelle Anders wasn't in it.

But Doogan was now.
