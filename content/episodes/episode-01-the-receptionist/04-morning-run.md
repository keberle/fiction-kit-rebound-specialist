## Scene 4 — Morning Run (Baxter in the Ear)

"—and then I cross-referenced her tagged photos with geo-metadata, found her dog's Instagram—"

"Her dog has Instagram?"

"Four thousand followers. The poodle posts from a specific farmer's market every Saturday morning. Hits the latte stand for a dog treat and the owner gets a trendy coffee. Almost always around the same time."

Doogan's legs burned. Three miles. Sweat stuck his shirt to his back, the morning air sharp in his lungs. The earpiece stayed clear despite his breathing.

"So where is she?"

"That's the thing. She's surprisingly hard to pin down for someone with an active social media presence. No check-ins, locations always turned off. But her friends aren't as careful, and her dog's account—"

"So the owner is paranoid but her dog, not so much?  Got to love SoCal."

The light changed. He picked up the pace again, feet hitting pavement in steady rhythm.

"What else do you have on her?"

"I'm still digging.  Everyone leaves a trail. That's like, the whole point of the internet." A pause. Keyboard clicking. "Do you always pay for the dates?"

Doogan nearly missed his stride. "Where's that coming from?"

"Abby mentioned it. That you always pick up the check."

"Yeah, I do."

"Even when they offer?"

"Especially when they offer." He dodged a woman walking a golden retriever. "Women get self-conscious about it sometimes. I'll joke, distract them. But I always pay."

"So the guy always has to?"

"Not about having to. It's about wanting to." Doogan crested a hill. "No expectations. That's the key. You pay because you enjoy their company, not because you think it buys you something."

"But—"

"These women—assistants, yoga instructors, receptionists—they get drawn to wealthy, powerful men who pay for dinner like it's an extension of paying for them. That provider thing women respond to. But when I do it?" He let gravity carry him down. "I'm just grateful for their time. That's the difference."

Baxter was quiet for a moment. "Is that how the rebounds have always gone? Like, back to the first one?" A beat. "Wait, what was the first one?"

"College. Eddie was my fraternity brother. VP of the frat had a problem."

"What kind of problem?"

"The trust fund kind. Hooking up with a girl from the sister sorority all semester. But he was secretly engaged to some family friend's daughter back home."

"Wait, he was cheating on his fiancée?"

"The fiancée didn't know about the sorority girl. The sorority girl didn't know about the fiancée. Classic mess." He slowed for a red light. "The VP panicked. Eddie found him—Eddie's always had a nose for desperate people with money."

"What did Eddie do?"

"Pitched him a solution. For a price, I'd charm the girl, make her grateful for the breakup, make sure she moved on cleanly." The light changed. "I thought Eddie was insane. Told him no."

"But you did it anyway."

"We were broke, neither of us from the kind of money our fraternity brothers came from. Eddie saw an opportunity, which is kind of his thing." He pushed forward, picking up speed. "So I found a way to 'accidentally' keep running into her. Coffee shop, library, one study session. Made her forget about trust fund boy."

"And it worked?"

"She told him she was grateful they could both move on. Wished him well." The memory still felt sharp. "Didn't even seem hurt. Just... relieved someone had actually paid attention to her."

"That's kind of genius."

"Eddie thought so. Started pitching me on making it a regular thing." Doogan was approaching Duke's Coffee now, the strip mall visible ahead. "I said no. This was one time, never again."

"But here you are."

"Here I am."

"So what changed?"

"I never found anything in college that I was any better at than this and Eddie can't resist a business opportunity."

Baxter made a sound like he was writing that down. "Got it. I guess you have to play to your strengths."

"Something like that."

More keyboard sounds. Then: "Oh! Got something. I faked a cosmetics company profile—got added to her Snapchat."

"That feels ethically questionable."

"All young social media addicts hope for an endorsement." Baxter's excitement was back. "She shares location to close friends, and now I'm a close friend. Well, GlamourGirl_Marketing is a close friend. But same thing."

"Where is she?"

"Not at the market yet but I'll keep an eye on her.  Oh, and the dog is a white teacup poodle"

"Sounds about right.  Please tell me its named Precious."

"No, looks like Coco.  That guess was oddly specific."

"You need to watch more movies, Baxter."

"You and Eddie both say that a lot.  I have a whole list now."

Doogan slowed to a walk, letting his heart rate settle. Duke's Coffee sat at the end of the strip, unremarkable except for Eddie's sedan in the parking lot.

"Good work, Baxter."

"Really?" His voice went up half an octave.

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late." A beat. "Hey, thanks for telling me about the first job. That's actually pretty cool."

"Helped me pass the time during my run."

"Going dark for the client meet?"

"Yeah. Keep digging on Annabelle. And see what you can find on this CEO."

"Yeah, he's definitely not an oversharer on social media but I'm still checking..."

"Keep looking.  Got to go." Doogan cut him off.

The line went quiet. Doogan pulled the door open and stepped into the air conditioning, scanning for Eddie's inevitable wave.
