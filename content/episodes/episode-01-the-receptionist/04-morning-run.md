## Scene 4 — Morning Run (Baxter in the Ear)

"—and then I cross-referenced her tagged photos with geo-metadata from her friends' public accounts, which gave me a pattern, and once I had the pattern I could narrow down to like three possible locations, and then I found her dog's Instagram—"

"Her dog has Instagram?"

"Her dog has four thousand followers." Baxter's voice buzzed in his ear, enthusiastic as always. "People are weird about their dogs."

Doogan was three miles into his run, cutting through the neighborhood streets, the morning air still cool enough to feel good. The earpiece was doing its job—Baxter's voice crystal clear despite his breathing.

"So where is she?"

"That's the thing. She's surprisingly hard to pin down for someone with an active social media presence. No check-ins, locations always turned off on her main account. But her friends aren't as careful, and her dog's account—"

"Is run by someone less paranoid."

"Exactly! The poodle posts from a specific farmer's market every Saturday morning. Multiple weeks in a row. Same vendor tags. Same time frame."

Doogan slowed at a crosswalk, jogging in place. "Farmer's market on a Saturday. That's not exactly unique."

"No, but her Instagram—her actual Instagram—has three photos from the same market in the last month. Different angles, but I matched the produce stand awnings. And get this: there's a coffee vendor she photographs constantly. Like, obsessively. Latte art with little hearts. I think she might have a thing for the barista."

"Or she just likes latte art."

"Nobody likes latte art that much."

The light changed. He picked up the pace again, feet hitting pavement in steady rhythm.

"What else do you have on her?"

"That's the weird part." Baxter's voice shifted, a note of frustration creeping in. "For someone with a public profile, there's not much background. Basic employment verification—she does work at LeClere's company, receptionist, like he said. But before that? It's thin. College records, previous jobs, family stuff—either she's really private or someone cleaned up her digital footprint."

"Or she's just not interesting enough to have left much of a trail."

"Everyone leaves a trail. That's like, the whole point of the internet." A pause. Keyboard clicking. "How did you and Eddie even do this before the internet?"

Doogan laughed, breath coming harder on an uphill stretch. "Very differently."

"No, but seriously. How did you find people? How did you get background information?"

"Phonebooks. Libraries. A lot of actually talking to human beings." I crested the hill and let gravity carry me down the other side. "You want to hear about the first job?"

"Yes. Obviously yes."

"College. Eddie and I were fraternity brothers—don't make that face."

"You can't see my face."

"I can hear it." I dodged a woman walking a golden retriever. "The VP of our fraternity—trust fund kid, everything handed to him—had a problem. He'd been hooking up with a girl from the sister sorority all semester. But he was secretly engaged to some family friend's daughter back home. Wealthy family. Promised him a job after graduation."

"Wait, he was cheating on his fiancée?"

"The fiancée didn't know about the sorority girl. The sorority girl didn't know about the fiancée. He needed to end things cleanly without risking the engagement or the career prospects."

"That's... messy."

"Very. And he was panicking." Doogan crested another hill, letting gravity pull him down the other side. "So he came to Eddie—well, Eddie found him, really. Eddie's always had a nose for desperate people with money."

"What did Eddie do?"

"Pitched him a solution. For a price, Doogan would charm the girl, make her grateful for the breakup, make sure she wished the VP well in his marriage." He slowed at a crosswalk, catching his breath. "I thought Eddie was insane. Told him no."

"But you did it anyway."

"We were broke. Eddie and I—we weren't trust fund kids. We were scraping by while surrounded by wealth. Rent was due. The Cougar needed a new transmission." The light changed. He pushed forward. "So I engineered a few chance encounters. Made her forget about trust fund boy entirely."

"And it worked?"

"She told the guy she was grateful they could both move on. Wished him happiness in his marriage." He was breathing harder now, the memory sharp despite the years. "She didn't even seem hurt. Just... relieved someone had actually paid attention to her."

"That's kind of amazing."

"Eddie immediately started pitching me on making it a regular thing. I said no. Absolutely not. This was a one-time favor."

"But here you are."

"Here I am." The light changed. Doogan started running again, slower now, cooling down. "The trick is not thinking about it too hard."

"You say that a lot."

"Because it's true a lot."

More keyboard sounds. Then: "Oh! Got something. I posed as a cosmetics company rep doing market research—got added to her Snapchat."

"That feels ethically questionable."

"It feels like doing my job." Baxter's excitement was back. "She shares location to close friends, and now I'm a close friend. Well, GlamourGirl_Marketing is a close friend. But same thing."

"Where is she?"

"Farmer's market. Saturday mornings. She posts from there constantly—and I've got timestamps now. She usually arrives around nine, stays until eleven. There's a pattern." A pause. "Also, she has a white teacup poodle."

"Of course she does."

"Very fluffy. Very photogenic. Very likely to approach strangers for attention based on the behavioral patterns I've observed in her videos."

"You've done behavioral analysis on a poodle?  Its not named 'Precious', is it?"

"I don't know, why?" Baxter was confused by the specific nature of the question.

"You really need to watch nore movies."

"You say that a lot too." Baxter didn't sound embarrassed. "The point is: farmer's market, Saturday morning, poodle. You've got your meet-cute location."

Doogan was approaching Duke's Coffee now—the strip mall facade visible ahead, morning light catching the windows. Sebastian LeClere and Eddie would be waiting inside.

"Good work, Baxter."

"Really?" His voice went up half an octave.

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late." A beat. "Hey, one more thing. The poodle's name is Coco. In case that helps."

"It might."

Doogan slowed to a walk, letting his heart rate settle. Duke's Coffee sat at the end of the strip, unremarkable except for Eddie's sedan in the parking lot.

"Going dark for the client meet."

"Copy that. I'll keep digging on Annabelle. There's something off about her digital presence—it's too clean. Like someone pruned it."

"Or like she's just a normal person who doesn't overshare."

"Nobody's that normal," Baxter said. "Nobody."

The line went quiet. He pulled the door open and stepped into the air conditioning, scanning for Eddie's inevitable wave.
