## Scene 5 — Coffeehouse Meet

Duke's Coffee smelled like dark roast and breakfast foods. Morning sun angled through the front windows. Eddie sat in a back booth, mid-pitch when Doogan walked up, still in running gear.

Eddie stopped. "Business casual?"

"Running gear is business casual for a farmer's market meet-cute." He slid into the booth across from them. "This buys me a reason to be jogging through the market later."

The man beside Eddie stood halfway, extending a hand. "Sebastian LeClere."

Firm handshake. Tailored shirt. Cologne that cost more than the breakfast. European accent, Belgian maybe, faint but consistent. Late forties, maybe early fifties.

"Eddie says you're very good at what you do."

"Eddie says a lot of things."

Sebastian smiled. "I appreciate discretion. This situation is... delicate."

Doogan signaled the server, ordered coffee. Sebastian's plate sat untouched—bacon, eggs, toast. The bacon glistened under the café lights.

"Tell me about Annabelle."

"She's wonderful. We had a connection—brief, but meaningful. But now its..."

"Complicated?"

Sebastian blinked. "Something like that."

"Complicated is kind of our thing." Eddie interrupted.

"What's her coffee preference?"

"I... I don't recall."

"Does she take lunch at her desk or go out?"

A pause. "I believe she goes out."

"Where?"

"I'm not certain."

Doogan leaned back. Sebastian leaned forward, compensating.

"My company is very important me and my position can be very demanding. I don't have time to—"

"Follow your receptionist around. I get it." His coffee arrived. He took a sip. "You're not married?"

"No."

"And what does this company do?"

"Medical billing."

"And you can't just transfer this girl to some other department or even just fire her for some HR friendly reason?"

Sebastian's smile tightened. "I prefer to avoid mess. Professional complications. Surely you understand."

Eddie jumped in. "What Doogan's getting at is, we need to know the situation to handle it right. Background. Context. How long have you two been—"

"A few months. Discretely. Now it's complicated." Sebastian looked at Doogan. "I'm told you're exceptional at making these transitions... comfortable."

"For who?"

"For everyone involved."

The coffee was good. Something about Sebastian didn't fit—the polished surface with nothing underneath, like an expensive suit on a mannequin.

Doogan stood. "I need to go. She'll be at the Farmer's market soon, and I've got a meet-cute to make happen."

"Wait, we haven't—"

"I'll handle it." He grabbed a piece of bacon from Sebastian's plate as he passed. "You should eat. You're paying for it."

Outside, the morning air felt cleaner. The sun had burned off the early haze.  Doogan was about half way to the Farmer's market when a call came in from Eddie, his voice slightly strained in Doogan's earpiece.

"That was fast."

"He doesn't know her. At all, Eddie."

"So?"

"So why hire us to break up with someone he's never dated?" Doogan bit into the bacon. "Something's off."

"You're still doing it, though."

He was. Because Annabelle existed, and whatever Sebastian's angle was, she didn't deserve to be caught in it.

"I'll meet her. See what I see."

"That's my guy."

"If this goes sideways—"

"It won't."
