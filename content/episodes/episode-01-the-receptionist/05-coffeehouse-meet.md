## Scene 5 — Coffeehouse Meet

"—so I told him, I said look, you want the premium service, you pay the premium price, that's how this works—" Eddie was mid-pitch when Doogan walked up to their table, still in running gear.

Eddie stopped. "Business casual?"

"Running gear is business casual for a farmer's market meet-cute." He pulled out a chair. "This buys me a reason to be jogging through the market later."

The man across from Eddie stood halfway, extending a hand. "Sebastian LeClere. You must be Doogan."

Firm handshake. Tailored shirt. Cologne that cost more than the breakfast. European accent, faint but consistent. Late forties, maybe early fifties.

"Eddie says you're very good at what you do."

"Eddie says a lot of things."

Sebastian smiled. "I appreciate discretion. This situation is... delicate."

Doogan signaled the server, ordered coffee. Sebastian's plate sat untouched—bacon, eggs, toast. The bacon glistened under the café lights.

"Tell me about Annabelle."

"She's wonderful. Bright, efficient. We had a connection—brief, but meaningful. Now she's pulling away, and I need to ensure the transition doesn't affect the office dynamic."

"What's her coffee order?"

Sebastian blinked. "Excuse me?"

"You work together. You had a connection. What does she drink?"

"I... I don't recall."

"Does she take lunch at her desk or go out?"

A pause. "I believe she goes out."

"Where?"

"I'm not certain."

Doogan leaned back. Sebastian leaned forward, compensating.

"I run a medical billing company. Emergence Medical Billing. Very specialized work, very demanding. I don't have time to—"

"Follow your receptionist around. I get it." His coffee arrived. He took a sip. "You're not married?"

"No."

"Then why not just ask her out properly? Take her to dinner, see where it goes?"

"The office dynamic—"

"Would survive dinner."

Sebastian's smile tightened. "I prefer to avoid mess. Professional complications. Surely you understand."

Eddie jumped in. "What Doogan's getting at is, we need to know the situation to handle it right. Background. Context. How long have you two been—"

"A few months. Casually. Now it's awkward." Sebastian looked at Doogan. "I'm told you're exceptional at making these transitions... comfortable."

"For who?"

"For everyone involved."

The coffee was good. Something about Sebastian didn't fit—the polished surface with nothing underneath, like an expensive suit on a mannequin.

Doogan stood. "I need to go. Farmer's market opens at nine, and I've got a meet-cute to engineer."

"Wait, we haven't—"

"I'll handle it." He grabbed a piece of bacon from Sebastian's plate as he passed. "You should eat. You're paying for it."

Outside, the morning air felt cleaner.

Eddie caught up with him at the corner. "That was fast."

"He doesn't know her. At all."

"So?"

"So why hire us to break up with someone he's never dated?" Doogan bit into the bacon. "Something's off."

"You're still doing it, though."

He was. Because Annabelle existed, and whatever Sebastian's angle was, she didn't deserve to be caught in it.

"I'll meet her. See what I see."

"That's my guy."

"If this goes sideways—"

"It won't."

It would. Doogan got in the Cougar and headed toward the market.
