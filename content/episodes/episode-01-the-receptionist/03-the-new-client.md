## Scene 3 — Eddie & Abby's Kitchen

"There he is!" Eddie was already talking before Doogan cleared the doorway. "Fresh from a broken heart, our hero, food's getting cold—"

The kitchen smelled like peanut sauce and lemongrass. Thai takeout containers lined the island, steam still rising from opened lids. Eddie was piling food onto plates, gesturing with chopsticks. She kissed Doogan's cheek and handed him a beer, condensation cold on the bottle. "Andrews. You survived."

"Barely." He took a long pull.

"Did that tetanus trap you call a car make it here, or should I call a tow truck preemptively?"

"The Cougar's fine."

"The Cougar is a rolling health code violation." She slid onto a barstool at the island, her silk blouse catching the overhead light. The granite counter was cool under her hands. "But I'm sure it has a lovely personality."

Eddie shoved a plate toward Doogan. Noodles spilled over the edge. "Okay, so, the new job—Sebastian LeClere. CEO, medical billing company. He's got a situation with his receptionist."

"What kind of situation?"

"The romantic kind. They had a thing, now he needs to focus on work, he wants it handled cleanly." Eddie grabbed a spring roll, bit into it. "Her name's Annabelle Anders. Late twenties. He says she's gotten distant, won't talk to him, whole thing's become awkward at the office."

"Is he married?"

"Says no."

Abby snorted into her wine glass.

"That's what he said." Eddie pointed at Doogan with his chopsticks. "The believing part is your department. That's why we meet in person. You do your thing, read the guy, figure out if he's lying."

Doogan pushed noodles around his plate. The smell of basil and fish sauce filled the kitchen. "Why does an unmarried CEO need us? Can't he just transfer her? Give her a raise and some distance?"

"Asked him that exact question. He said it's delicate. Personal. Doesn't want her to feel rejected, doesn't want office drama, wants someone to—and I'm quoting here—'help her move on gracefully.'"

"That's what they all say." Abby injected.

"It's what they all say because it's what they all want! That's literally our business model."

Abby set down her chopsticks. "Let me guess. You already set a meeting."

"Tomorrow. Ten o'clock. Duke's Coffee. Business casual."

She burst out laughing.

Doogan looked at her. "What?"

"Nothing." She was still grinning. "I just find it fascinating that every time you get a sketchy client with a weird request, the meeting happens at some random coffee shop in the middle of nowhere." She started counting on her fingers. "Duke's. That place on Silver Lake with the cheeky imitation Hawaiian art?"

"Duke's has good scones."

"That's not a defense, Eddie." Doogan added, loosely agreeing with Abby.

"It's not a defense, it's a statement of fact. They have excellent scones. And the location is about discretion, which—"

"Plausible deniability." Doogan added.

"—which is a service we provide." Eddie turned to Doogan, shifting gears without missing a beat. "Look. I'm not saying it's a guaranteed yes. I'm saying meet the guy, read him, see what your gut tells you. If it's a no, we walk. Done. No hard feelings."

"My gut already says no."

"Your gut said no to Hendricks. Remember Hendricks? That job paid for the new roof."

Abby's eyebrow went up. "That's where the roof money came from?"

"Well, its not like I could pull it from the designer handbag budget." Eddie said, firing a shot back at Abby.  "The point is—" Eddie barreled forward, "—Doogan, just take the meeting. Sit down with Sebastian. Let him talk. Either he's what he says he is, or he's not, and either way, you'll know in five minutes." He grabbed a spring roll and took a bite. "That's all I'm asking. One meeting."

Eddie wasn't wrong. Doogan wouldn't know until he sat across from Sebastian LeClere.

"Fine. I'll be there."

"That's my guy.  Let's go with business casual.  These CEO types seem to notice those things and maybe take an uber." Eddie said throwing shade on Doogan's car again.

Abby stood and collected plates, stacking them with precision. "Take the Cougar tomorrow. At least you'll look interesting."

"Thanks."

"You're welcome, Andrews." Her smile went sharp. "Try not to fall for this one."

Doogan stood, leaving his half-finished beer on the counter. He didn't dignify that with a response.
