## Scene 3 — Eddie & Abby's Kitchen

"There he is!" Eddie was already talking before Doogan cleared the doorway. "Fresh from a broken heart, our hero, food's getting cold, we got pad thai, we got drunken noodles, we got spring rolls—Abby insisted on the spring rolls even though nobody ever eats the spring rolls, but that's a whole separate conversation we don't need to have right now."

Their kitchen gleamed—white quartz countertops, brushed nickel fixtures, the kind of carefully curated space that looked effortless but cost serious money. Thai takeout containers lined the marble island like soldiers awaiting inspection.

"I eat the spring rolls," Abby said, emerging from the hallway. She wore a silk blouse the color of champagne, tailored linen pants, gold jewelry that caught the pendant lights. Even at home, she looked ready for a magazine shoot. She kissed Doogan's cheek and handed him a beer. "Andrews. You survived."

"Barely."

"Did that tetanus trap you call a car make it here, or should I call a tow truck preemptively?"

"The Cougar's fine."

"The Cougar is a rolling health code violation." She slid onto a barstool, crossing her legs. "But I'm sure it has a lovely personality."

Eddie was piling food onto plates, gesturing with chopsticks. "Okay, so, the new job—and I'm just going to get right into it because I've been sitting on this all day and Abby keeps making that face like I'm hiding something, which, technically, yes, I was waiting for you, but that's not hiding, that's strategic timing—"

"Those are the same thing when you do them," Abby said.

"They're not. They're related but distinct concepts. Anyway." Eddie shoved a plate toward Doogan. "Sebastian LeClere. Wealthy guy, CEO of some kind of medical billing company, very polished on the phone. He's got a situation with his receptionist."

"What kind of situation?"

"The romantic kind. They had a thing, now she's pulling away, he wants it handled cleanly. Professionally." Eddie was already onto his next thought. "Her name's Annabelle Anders. Late twenties. Smart, pretty, exactly his type—his words, not mine. He says she's gotten distant, won't talk to him, whole thing's become awkward at the office."

"Is he married?"

"Says no."

Abby snorted into her wine glass.

"What?" Eddie spread his hands. "That's what he said."

"And you believed him."

"I didn't say I believed him, I said that's what he said. There's a difference. The believing part is Doogan's department." He pointed at me. "That's why we meet in person. So you can do your thing, read the guy, figure out if he's lying or just sad or what."

Doogan pushed noodles around his plate. "Why does an unmarried CEO need us? Can't he just transfer her? Give her a raise and some distance?"

"Asked him that exact question. He said it's delicate. Personal. Doesn't want her to feel rejected, doesn't want office drama, wants someone to—and I'm quoting here—'help her move on gracefully.'"

"That's what they all say."

"It's what they all say because it's what they all want! That's literally our business model."

Abby set down her chopsticks. "Let me guess. You already set a meeting."

"Tomorrow. Ten o'clock. Duke's Coffee. Business casual."

She burst out laughing.

Doogan looked at her. "What?"

"Nothing." She was still grinning. "I just find it fascinating that every time you get a sketchy client with a weird request, the meeting happens at some random coffee shop in the middle of nowhere." She started counting on her fingers. "Duke's. That place in Silver Lake with all the goat paintings. The tea house that was definitely money laundering."

"Duke's has good scones."

"That's not a defense, Eddie."

"It's not a defense, it's a statement of fact. They have excellent scones. And the location is about discretion, which—"

"Plausible deniability."

"—which is a service we provide." Eddie turned to Doogan, shifting gears without missing a beat. "Look. I'm not saying it's a guaranteed yes. I'm saying meet the guy, read him, see what your gut tells you. If it's a no, we walk. Done. No hard feelings."

"My gut already says no."

"Your gut said no to Hendricks. Remember Hendricks? That job paid for the new roof."

Abby's eyebrow went up. "That's where the roof money came from?"

"The point is—" Eddie barreled forward, "—Doogan's gut is an asset, not a veto. You use it to read people, not to avoid meeting them. Sit down with Sebastian. Let him talk. Either he's what he says he is, or he's not, and either way, you'll know in five minutes." He grabbed a spring roll and took a bite. "That's all I'm asking. One meeting."

The Thai food was good. Eddie's pitch was the same as it always was—half logic, half momentum, completely relentless. And he wasn't wrong. Doogan wouldn't know until he sat across from Sebastian LeClere.

"Fine. One meeting."

"That's my guy."

"If I say no, you drop it?"

"Scout's honor."

"You were never a scout."

"I was briefly a scout. There was an incident involving a campfire and a can of aerosol—you know what, not relevant. Point is, we're set."

Abby stood and collected plates. "Take the Cougar tomorrow. It'll make you look eccentric instead of suspicious."

"Thanks for the endorsement."

"You're welcome, Andrews." Her smile went sharp. "Try not to fall for this one."

Doogan didn't dignify that with a response.
