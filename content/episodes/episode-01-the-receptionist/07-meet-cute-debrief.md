## Scene 7 — The Meet Cute Debrief

"—it went fine, she asked me to come back. Next Saturday."

Doogan stepped off of the elevator, arriving at his floor and headed down the hall to his condo.

"To the farmer's market?" Eddie's voice carried that salesman energy even on the phone. "That's good, that's really good, actually. Better than I expected for a first contact."

"Yeah, well." Doogan entered the code to the door and headed into his condo with its modern, urban aesthetic. "I left first. Gave her space to think about it."

"Smart. Classic move. Leave them wanting more."

The condo was perfectly decorated, muted tones, no detail missing. Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the city skyline—city lights starting to flicker on as dusk settled. The place was immaculate. Always. A sectional sofa in charcoal gray, positioned for the view, exposed brick, dark elegance. A low coffee table with fresh flowers, regularly swapped out, the tv remote and a hardback novel, nothing accidental. Not cluttered, just enough to be interesting but nothing too personal, too messy.

Except the kitchen.

That was different.

Doogan set his phone on the soapstone, veined in dark simplicity, Doogan switched the call to speaker. The kitchen ran along the far wall, open to the living space: custom cabinetry in warm walnut, commercial-grade range with six burners and a griddle, Sub-Zero fridge that cost more than his Cougar. Knife block with German steel. Copper pots hanging from a ceiling rack, aligned by size.

This was where he felt in control.

"Okay, but here's the thing," Eddie said. "Sebastian isn't the patient type. One meet-cute per week? That's going to feel slow to him. He's going to want results."

Doogan opened the fridge—mostly empty, except for essentials. Butter, good parmesan, a few vegetables. He didn't keep much here unless he was cooking. "Then we manage his expectations."

"Or we speed things up." Eddie's tone shifted—pitching mode. "I'm just saying, Baxter could probably find—"

"Already on it." Baxter's voice cut in, tinny through the phone's speaker. "I pulled her transaction history. She shops at Gelsons almost every night. Always around six, six-thirty."

Doogan closed the fridge. Leaned against the counter, arms crossed. Through the windows, the skyline glowed—high-rises and palm trees, the sprawl of Southern California stretching toward the coast.

"Every night?" That was Eddie, perking up. "That's a pattern."

"Someone who doesn't plan too far ahead, shops for her appetite after a work day," Doogan said. "Lives alone. Probably doesn't meal-prep."

"So we set up another 'coincidence.'" Eddie was already building the pitch. "You show up at Gelsons Monday night. 'Oh, hey, fancy seeing you here.' Gets us moving faster."

Doogan didn't answer immediately. He stared out at the city—the lights, the distance, the clean separation between here and down there.

"You still there?" Eddie asked.

"Yeah."

"What's the problem?"

"No problem."

"Doogan."

"I said no problem."

A beat of silence. Then Eddie, quieter: "You like her."

"I met her once."

"And?"

"And she's smart. Sharp. Quick on her feet but young, sweet...not damaged yet."

"Great. Perfect. That makes the job easier."

"Or harder."

Eddie sighed—long-suffering, affectionate. "Look, you always do this. You meet them, you connect, you start overthinking. It's part of the process. It's why you're good at it."

"And if I'm not overthinking?"

"Then you're lying to yourself, which is also part of the process."

Doogan almost smiled. Pushed off the counter and moved to the windows. The condo felt too big sometimes. Too perfect. Like a stage set for a life he didn't actually live but it worked, time and time again.

"Monday night," Eddie said. "Gelsons. You can help her decide what she wants for dinner. Just say you're there anyway, right? Just shopping. Total coincidence."

"Sure."

"I'll update Sebastian. Keep him happy."

"Yeah."

From the phone, Baxter's voice piped up again. "Hey, Doogan? She's been stalking your Instagram."

Doogan blinked. "Already?"

"Yeah, she wasted no time. She viewed your profile four times since the Farmer's market. Scrolled through photos, read the comments, two of them.  She seems especially interested in the cooking and sailing pics."

Eddie laughed. "Good. She's doing her homework. Good job on the social media, Baxter. Looks legit."

"Thanks. I update it twice a week. Keeps the algorithm happy."

Doogan rubbed his face. Turned away from the windows. The kitchen always felt like home turf to Doogan. He'd designed this space for exactly one thing: cooking for someone else, something intimate.

"Doogan?" Eddie again. "You good?"

"Yeah. I'm good."

"Monday night."

"Monday night."

"And hey—relax, alright? You're going to do great. You always do."

The call ended. Silence filled the condo.

Doogan stood in his perfect kitchen, in his perfect apartment, looking out at a city full of lights and people and lives that weren't his.

He thought about Annabelle. The way she'd laughed at his terrible jokes. The way she'd called him handsome without hesitation.

The way he was going to lie to her on Monday.

He pulled a bottle of water out of the fridge and headed into his room to shower from his morning run.
