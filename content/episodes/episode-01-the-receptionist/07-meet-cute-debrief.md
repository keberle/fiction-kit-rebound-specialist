## Scene 7 — The Meet Cute Debrief

"—and you just *left*?"

Eddie was staring at Doogan like he'd confessed to a felony.

"I left."

"You had her. She was into you. The dog was *obsessed* with you—and you walked away without getting her number, without suggesting coffee, without—"

"She asked me to come back next Saturday."

Eddie stopped. Processed. His face cycled through confusion, skepticism, and finally landed on grudging respect.

"She asked *you*."

"To the farmer's market. Next Saturday."

"Huh." He dropped into a chair. "That's actually better."

"That's the whole point. You don't close too fast. Leave them curious."

"Yeah, ok...but this CEO isn't the patient type, Doogan.  He's going to want things to move a bit faster than one Saturday at a time."

From the tablet on the counter, Baxter's voice cut in. "Wait, I don't get it. Why is that better? She was interested. Why not just ask her out?"

Eddie and Doogan exchanged a look. Abby, at the kitchen island with her laptop and wine, didn't even glance up.

"Baxter," Eddie said, pivoting into mentor mode, "when you're in too early, you're just another guy. But when *she* makes the move—when she's the one asking—now she's invested. Now she's thinking about you. That's the difference between a date and a *connection*."

"But isn't that... manipulative?"

Abby snorted. "Welcome to the business model, Baxter."

"It's not manipulation," Eddie said. "It's—"

"It's manipulation." Abby still hadn't looked up. "It's just manipulation that works. Which, I suppose, is what makes it manipulation."

Eddie turned to her. "You want to do this again? Right now?"

"No." She finally met his eyes. "I want to do this *every* time, because the day I stop pointing out how ridiculous this is, I become complicit."

"You're already complicit. You do our books."

"I'm *aware*." She took a sip of wine. "The cognitive dissonance keeps me sharp."

Doogan cut in before this became the argument they'd had a hundred times. "What do we have on her? Background. Patterns."

Baxter's face shifted on screen. "Not much. Social media's basically empty. LinkedIn exists but there's no job listed, no connections. Instagram is coffee art and the dog. She's weirdly private."

"What about Sebastian's company?" Doogan asked. "Anything that puts her at Emergence Medical Billing?"

"Nothing public. No employee directory, no photos, no LinkedIn connection to the company." Baxter shrugged. "But most medical billing companies keep a low profile. Not exactly Instagram material."

Fair point. Nobody posts selfies from cubicles full of insurance claims.

"Transaction patterns?" Eddie leaned forward. "Anything useful?"

Baxter hesitated. "I mean... technically that's not exactly—"

"Just tell us what you found."

"There's a Gelsons. She shops there almost every night. Like, she's there at least five times a week. Always around six, six-thirty."

"Every night?" Abby looked up. "Who shops for groceries every night?"

"Someone who cooks fresh every night," Doogan said. "Someone who lives alone and doesn't want leftovers."

"Or someone who doesn't have anything else to do." Eddie was already calculating. "Either way, that's a pattern. That's an opportunity."

"That's stalking," Abby said.

"It's research-based positioning."

"It's stalking with a credit card statement."

"Could you find her address?" Doogan asked Baxter.

He shook his head. "That's where it gets weird. The billing address on everything routes to a PO Box. Can't get a physical location."

"So we know where she shops but not where she lives."

"Pretty much."

Eddie spread his hands. "So? You show up at Gelsons. 'What a coincidence.' Start from there.  At least it gets us on a slightly faster pace than one hour each Saturday."

Abby closed her laptop. "I want it on the record that I think this whole thing is ridiculous. And you—" She pointed at Doogan. "—are going to end up actually liking this woman."

"I'm not—"

"You always do." She stood, collecting her wine. "Five nights a week at Gelsons. Pick one. Try not to look too surprised when you 'accidentally' run into her."

She walked out. Eddie and Doogan sat in the silence she left behind.

"She's not wrong," Eddie said finally.

"I know."

He drummed his fingers on the counter. "Monday night. You good?"

"I'm good."

"And if Sebastian asks about progress?"

"Tell him I'm working on it. Tell him patience."

Eddie snorted. "Yeah. I'll tell him patience."

Doogan was almost to the door when he called after him.

"Hey. The leaving first thing. Making her ask you to come back." He was almost smiling. "That was smooth."

"Basic psychology."

"Still smooth."

It was. That was the problem.
