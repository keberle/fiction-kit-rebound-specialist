## Scene 1 — The Dumping

The candle between them flickered. Claire set down her wine glass with the kind of precision lawyers use when they're about to deliver bad news.

"I think we should stop seeing each other."

Doogan had known it was coming. Had felt it all week. Still landed like a punchline he wasn't ready for.

"Okay."

"Okay?" She blinked. "That's it?"

"What were you expecting? Tears? A dramatic exit through the kitchen?"

"I don't know. Maybe one question."

"Alright." He leaned back. "Can I still get the bread basket refilled?"

Her laugh came quick and genuine. "God, I'm going to miss that."

"The bread basket?"

"The way you do that. Deflect with a joke when something actually matters."

"Who says this matters?"

"You do. You're doing the hand thing."

Doogan looked down. His thumb was tracing circles on the tablecloth. He stopped.

"Lawyer tricks," he said. "Observing body language. Very unfair."

"Three months of dinners, Doogan. I've learned a few things." She leaned forward. "So. Aren't you going to ask why?"

"Do I need to?"

"Humor me."

"Why?"

She smiled—not sad, not apologetic. Proud. "Because three months ago I couldn't get through a deposition without hiding in the bathroom. Now I've got a hearing next week that actually matters and I think I'm going to win."

"You're going to destroy them."

"See? That. You say it like you mean it."

"I do mean it."

"I know you do. That's the whole point." She traced the rim of her glass. "You made me believe I could do this. And now I actually do. Which means—"

"You don't need the training wheels anymore."

"I was going to say 'safety net,' but yours is better."

"I'm excellent at metaphors. It's one of my many gifts."

"Along with modesty."

"Exactly."

She laughed again, and something in his chest tightened. He'd gotten good at making her laugh. Probably too good.

The waiter materialized. "Can I get you anything else?"

"Just the check," Claire said, then glanced at him. "Unless you want dessert?"

"Are you asking as someone who's dumping me, or someone who wants to prolong this?"

"Can't it be both?"

"Feels like mixed signals, Counselor."

"I'm a complex person."

"You're a person who wants tiramisu."

"I really do."

"Then we should get tiramisu." Doogan looked up at the waiter. "One with two forks. And another ten minutes before you bring the check."

He nodded and vanished.

Claire watched him with that look—the one that saw too much. "You're being very gracious about this."

"What's the alternative? Make a scene? Beg you to reconsider over Italian desserts?"

"You could at least pretend to be a little upset."

"Who says I'm not?"

"Your face. Your tone. Your entire demeanor."

"Lawyer tricks again."

"Doogan."

He met her eyes. The candlelight caught those gold flecks he'd noticed that first night at the bar near her firm. The ones he'd spent three months pretending not to memorize.

"I'm happy for you," he said. And meant it. Mostly. "You're going to walk into that hearing and win. You're going to keep winning. And you won't need anyone telling you that anymore."

"I'll miss hearing it from you, though."

"You'll miss the free dinners."

"That too." She smiled. "And the way you always order the exact wrong wine and make it work anyway."

"It's a skill."

"And your completely unearned confidence about restaurant choices."

"This place was excellent."

"You've been mispronouncing 'gnocchi' all night."

"The waiter understood me."

"The waiter is being paid to understand you."

"See? I contribute to the economy. I'm a job creator."

The tiramisu arrived. They ate in comfortable silence for a minute.

"For what it's worth," Doogan said finally, "I think you're making the right call."

"You're agreeing with me dumping you." She pointed her fork at him. "That's either very mature or deeply suspicious."

"Can't it be both?"

"Now you're stealing my lines."

"You won't need them anymore. I'm recycling."

She laughed again—the kind that made her nose wrinkle. "This is why I'm going to miss you. The smile, the jokes, the way you make everything feel lighter even when it shouldn't."

"If you keep talking like that, people will think you actually like me."

"I do actually like you. That's not why I'm ending this."

"I know."

And he did. That was the thing. She was right about all of it—the timing, the logic, the whole reason they were sitting here. It was the right call.

Didn't mean it didn't sting.

The waiter returned with the check. Claire reached for it out of politeness, but Doogan was faster.

"I've got this."

"You always do."

"It's one of my many—"

"Gifts. Yes. I remember." She watched him sign the receipt. "Doogan?"

"Yeah?"

"This was real. You know that, right? What we had—what you did for me. It was real."

"I know."

"Good." She stood, picking up her jacket. "Because even though its over, this did matter. You matter. The last three months matter."

He stood too, folding the pen in with the signed receipt into the leather check folder. The smile came easy. Easier than it should have.

"Come on," he said. "I'll walk you out."
