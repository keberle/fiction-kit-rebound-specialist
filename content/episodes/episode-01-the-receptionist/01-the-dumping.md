## Scene 1 — The Dumping

"I think we should stop seeing each other."

Doogan had known it was coming. Had felt it all week. The words still hit.

"Okay."

"Okay?" She blinked. "That's it?"

"What were you expecting? Tears? A dramatic exit through the kitchen?"

"I don't know. Maybe one question."

"Alright." He leaned back. "Have you looked at the dessert menu, its supposed to be amazing?"

Her laugh came quick and genuine.

"The dessert menu?"

"The way you do that. Deflect with a joke when something matters."

"Who says this matters?"

"You do. You're doing the hand thing."

Doogan looked down. His thumb was tracing circles on the tablecloth. He stopped.

"Lawyer tricks," he said. "Observing body language. Very unfair."

"We've had a lot of dinners, Doogan. I've learned a few things." She leaned forward. "So. Aren't you going to ask why?"

"Do I need to?"

"Humor me."

"Why?"

She smiled—not sad, not apologetic. Proud. "Because a few weeks ago I couldn't get through a deposition without hiding in the bathroom. Now I've got a hearing next week and I think I'm going to win."

"You're going to destroy them."

"See? That. You say it like you mean it." She traced the rim of her glass. "After my divorce I felt broken but you helped me remember who I was before that. Which means—"

"You don't need me anymore."

"I was going to say 'I'm ready to take the next steps on my own'."

"And I'll be the lost one now."

She laughed. "We both know that's not going to happen." He'd gotten good at making her laugh. Probably too good.

The waiter appeared at their table. The restaurant hummed with quiet conversations, silverware against plates. "Can I get you anything else?"

"Just the check," Claire said, then glanced at him. "What was that about the dessert menu?"

"Are you asking as someone who's dumping me, or someone who wants to prolong this?"

"A little of both, honestly."

"Mixed signals, Counselor."

"I'm a complex person."

"You're a person who wants tiramisu."

"I really do." she said, a little shy about admitting that.

"Then we should get tiramisu." Doogan looked up at the waiter. "One with two forks. And another ten minutes before you bring the check."

He nodded and slipped away between tables.

Claire watched him with that look—the one that saw too much. "You're being very gracious about this."

"What's the alternative? Make a scene? Beg you to reconsider over Italian desserts?"

"You could at least pretend to be a little upset."

"Who says I'm not?"

"Your face. Your tone. Your entire demeanor."

"Lawyer tricks again."

"Doogan."

He met her eyes. The candlelight caught those gold flecks he'd noticed that first night at the bar near her firm. The ones he'd spent weeks pretending not to memorize. The wine in her glass caught the light, amber and warm.

"I'm happy for you," he said. And meant it. Mostly. "You're going to walk into that hearing and win. You're going to keep winning. And you won't need anyone telling you that anymore."

"I'll miss hearing it from you, though. And I'll miss your cooking."

"The lasagna convinced you I was worth keeping around?"

"It is a hell of a lasagna." She smiled. "Which was the problem."

"Nah.  If I've learned one thing about you, its that you don't let something as innocent as a man cooking change your mind."

"There's nothing innocent about your cooking."

"It's a convenient skill."

"And your completely unearned confidence.  I'll miss that too."

"I am definitely more at home in my kitchen.  I'm less confident in restaurants."

"You've been mispronouncing 'gnocchi' all night."

"The waiter understood me."

"The waiter is being paid to understand you."

"See? When I cook, no one notices."

"I noticed...every time."

"Yes, I believe that." Doogan looked down, then up.  Make eye contact.

The tiramisu arrived—layers of cream and coffee-soaked cake, cocoa dusted across the top. The first bite was sweet, the espresso sharp underneath. They ate in comfortable silence for a minute.

"For what it's worth," Doogan said finally, "I think you're making the right call."

"About the restaurant?  We both know what would happen if you cooked for me again." she said hinting at what had happened every time he had cooked for her.

"About ending it.  Although, dinner at might place would have been more fun."

"You're agreeing with me dumping you." She pointed her fork at him. "That's either very mature or deeply suspicious."

"I'm a complicated man."

"You're a man who avoids direct answers."

"You won't need them anymore. I'm recycling."

She laughed again—the kind that made her nose wrinkle. "This is why I'm going to miss you. The smile, the jokes, the way you make everything feel lighter even when it shouldn't."

"If you keep talking like that, people will think you like me."

"I do like you. That's not why I'm ending this."

"I know."

And he did. She was right about all of it—the timing, the logic, the whole reason they were sitting here. It was the right call.

Didn't mean it didn't sting.

The waiter returned with the check. Claire reached for it out of politeness, but Doogan was faster.

"I've got this."

"You always do." She watched him sign the receipt. "Doogan?"

"Yeah?"

"This was real. You know that, right? What we had—what you did for me. It was real."

"I know."

"Good." She stood, picking up her jacket. "You weren't just some...I don't know...rebound thing. You matter. These last few weeks matter."

He stood too, folding the pen in with the signed receipt into the leather check folder.

"Come on," he said. "I'll walk you out."
