## Scene 9 — Dinner at Annabelle's

"Sorry about the mess." Annabelle kicked a pair of running shoes under the couch as he followed her inside.

The condo was small but camera-ready. Plants on the windowsill. Design magazines fanned across the coffee table.

"This is mess?" Doogan set the grocery bag on the kitchen counter. "You should see my place."

"I'm sure it has character."

"That's a polite way of describing chaos."

She laughed and opened a cabinet. "Utensils. I have a pan, a wooden spoon, and—" She held up a cheese grater. "This."

"That'll do."

He unpacked the groceries while she cleared counter space. The kitchen opened to the living room, no walls between them. Coco appeared from somewhere and sat at his feet, tail wagging.

"She remembers you."

"I'm memorable."

"That remains to be seen." Annabelle leaned against the counter, watching him work. "You really know what you're doing."

"Risotto's easy. You just have to pay attention."

He heated the pan, started the shallots. The rhythm came naturally—dice, sauté, deglaze. She handed him things before he asked for them.

"Oh—wait." She disappeared into the living room and returned with a wine bottle. "A client gave me this. Supposed to be really good."

Doogan took it. Woodmark Vineyards, Napa. The label looked expensive but unfamiliar.

"You don't recognize it."

"I'm more of a beer guy."

"Liar. You knew my risotto order at Providence." She found two glasses. "You're full of surprises."

"I contain multitudes."

"You said that at the market."

"Still true."

She opened the bottle and poured. The wine was pale gold.

"To coincidences," she said, raising her glass.

"And grocery stores."

They drank. The chardonnay was decent, not great. Doogan might have undersold his wine knowledge. He added rice to the pan, stirred, let it toast.

"This is nice," Annabelle said. "I don't usually—"

"Invite strangers to cook?"

"Trust people this fast." She was closer now, watching him work. "But you don't feel like a stranger."

"That's usually a good thing."

"I think it can be a dangerous thing."

"Can I ask you something?"

"You just did."

She smiled. "Why aren't you married?"

The question landed somewhere unexpected. He stirred the risotto. "Never found the right timing."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer I've got."

"Hmm." She refilled their glasses. "My last boyfriend said I was too much work. Too demanding. Too—" She waved a hand. "Everything."

"He sounds like an idiot."

"He was. That's not the point." She set down the bottle. "The point is I believed him. For a while. Then I decided I'd rather be alone than be someone's compromise."

The risotto was silky now, coming together.

"That's not nothing."

"That's not a compliment."

"Sure it is." He met her eyes. "Most people settle. You didn't. That takes guts."

Her guard dropped.

"You're good at this."

"Cooking?"

"Everything." She set down her glass and turned him toward her. "The talking. The timing. Is this why all the podcasts rave about more experienced men?"

"Is that another way of saying older?"

"That's not a bad thing."

"It's honest."

She kissed him. Soft at first, then certain. He kissed her back and felt the familiar pull—the moment when the job stopped being a job and became something else.

The risotto could wait.

She led him toward the bedroom. Coco whined from the kitchen.

"She'll survive," Annabelle said.

The bedroom was dark, the sheets cool. She was warm. She was laughing.

"The radiator in my first place," she said. "It sounded like a goat being strangled."

"The Cougar's transmission makes the same noise."

"We should introduce them."

They were both laughing, and then they weren't laughing anymore.

Afterward, she traced patterns on his chest.

"This wasn't the plan," she said.

"Plans change."

"Do they?" She propped herself up on one elbow. "You don't seem like someone whose plans change."

"What do I seem like?"

"Someone who always knows the next move."

He didn't answer. Couldn't, really. Because she was right. And because for the first time in a long time, he didn't know the next move. Didn't want to.

She fell asleep with her head on his shoulder. Her breathing evened out. The room was quiet.

Doogan stared at the ceiling. Sebastian's lies. Annabelle's trust. The math didn't add up, and he couldn't stop running the numbers.

He closed his eyes.

Doogan opened his eyes. The room was wrong—too bright, too cold. A man stood over him. Badge. Hard expression.

"Rough night?"

The detective pointed beside him.

Doogan turned his head.

Annabelle. Still. Too still.

Her eyes open. Fixed.

Dead.

"Hands where I can see them," the detective said.
