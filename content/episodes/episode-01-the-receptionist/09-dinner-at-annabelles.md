## Scene 9 — Dinner at Annabelle's

"Sorry about the mess." Annabelle kicked a pair of running shoes under the couch as he followed her inside.

The condo was small but camera-ready. Plants on the windowsill. Design magazines fanned across the coffee table.

"This is mess?" Doogan set the grocery bag on the kitchen counter. "You should see my place." he said, humility was always best in these situations.

"I'm sure it has character."

"That's a polite way of describing it."

She laughed and opened a cabinet. "Utensils. I have a pan, a wooden spoon, and—" She held up a cheese grater. "This."

"That'll do."

He unpacked the groceries while she cleared counter space. The kitchen opened to the living room, no walls between them. Coco appeared from the bedroom and sat at his feet, tail wagging hopefully.

"She remembers you."

"I'm memorable."

"That remains to be seen." Annabelle leaned against the counter beside him, close enough to hand him things. "You really know what you're doing."

"Risotto's easy. You just have to pay attention."

He heated the pan, the burner clicking to life. Started the shallots. The smell hit immediately—sweet, sharp. His hands moved—dice, sauté, deglaze. The knife found its rhythm. She handed him things before he asked for them.

"Oh—wait." She disappeared into the living room and returned with a wine bottle. "Our billing company rep gave me this. Supposed to be really good."

Doogan took it. Woodmark Vineyards, Napa. The label looked expensive but not familiar.

"You don't recognize it."

"I'm more of a beer guy."

"Liar. You knew my risotto order at Providence, even nailed the wine choice" She found two glasses. "You're full of surprises."

"Hopefully good ones." he said jokingly.

"Looking good so far." She said, her eyes darting back to his like she was caught checking him out.  She smiled, opened the bottle and poured. The wine was pale gold, catching the kitchen light.

"To coincidences," she said, raising her glass.

"And grocery stores."

They drank. The chardonnay was decent, smooth going down. Doogan added rice to the pan, stirred, let it toast. The grains crackled, turning translucent at the edges.

"This is nice," Annabelle said. "I don't usually—"

"Invite strangers to cook?"

"Trust people this fast." She was closer now, watching him work. Watching his hands. "But you don't feel like a stranger."

"That's usually a good thing."

"I think it can be a dangerous thing."

She refilled their glasses. He added stock to the rice, one ladle at a time. The rhythm was meditative—stir, wait, add more. She stood close enough he could smell her perfume under the cooking smells.

"Can I ask you something?"

"You just did."

She smiled. "Why aren't you married?"

"How do you know I'm not married?"

"I *might* have checked you out online?"

"And?" he asked playfully.

"I only looked for a bit but you certainly seem single." she said downplaying what was clear an online stalking session.

The question landed somewhere unexpected. He stirred the risotto, adding another ladle of stock. "Never found the right timing, I guess."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer I've got."

"Hmm." She drank, then refilled both glasses again. The bottle was half gone now. "My last boyfriend said I was too much work. Too demanding. Too—" She waved a hand. "Everything."

"He sounds like an idiot."

"He was. That's not the point." She set down the bottle, swaying slightly. "The point is I believed him. For a while. Then I decided I'd rather be alone than be someone's compromise."

The risotto was silky now, coming together. Steam rose from the pan, carrying the smell of butter and cheese. Doogan's head felt... strange. Light. Like he'd had more than two glasses.

"That's not nothing."

"That's not a compliment."

"Sure it is." He met her eyes. Had to focus to keep them in frame. "Most people settle. You didn't. That takes..."

"Guts," she finished, smiling. She reached for her glass, knocked it slightly. Wine sloshed. "Oops."

"You okay?"

"Fine. Just—" She laughed. "I think that wine is stronger than I thought."

Doogan's hands felt heavy. The spoon was harder to hold. He stirred slower, trying to concentrate. The kitchen tilted slightly.

"Maybe we should eat," he said. His voice sounded far away.

"Maybe." But she wasn't moving toward plates. She was moving toward him. "You're good at this."

"Cooking?"

"Everything." Her hand on his chest. "The talking. The timing. The... you."

She kissed him. Soft at first, then certain. He kissed her back and felt the room shift. Not metaphorically. Actually shift. The floor wasn't quite level anymore.

"Annabelle—"

"Bedroom," she said, taking his hand.

He followed because his feet were moving but his brain was lagging behind, processing slowly, everything wrapped in cotton. The risotto. They hadn't eaten the risotto. That seemed important but he couldn't remember why.

The bedroom was dark. She was laughing, pulling him toward the bed. Coco whined from somewhere far away. The kitchen? Had they left the stove on?

Doogan's knees buckled. The bed caught him. Annabelle was saying something but the words blurred together, sound without meaning. Her face above his, then beside his, then gone. The ceiling was spinning. Or he was spinning. Both.

His eyes wouldn't stay open.

Everything went dark.

Doogan opened his eyes. The room was wrong—too bright, too cold. A man stood over him. Badge. Hard expression.

"Rough night?"

The detective pointed beside him.

Doogan turned his head.

Annabelle. Still. Too still.

Her eyes open. Fixed.

Dead.

"Hands where I can see them," the detective said.
