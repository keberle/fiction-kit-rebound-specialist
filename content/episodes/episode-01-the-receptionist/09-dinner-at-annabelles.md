## Scene 9 — Dinner at Annabelle's

"Sorry about the mess." Annabelle kicked a pair of running shoes under the couch as he followed her inside.

The condo was small but carefully kept—modern furniture, plants on the windowsill, a stack of design magazines on the coffee table. Not messy. Camera ready.

"This is mess?" Doogan set the grocery bag on the kitchen counter. "You should see my place."

"I'm sure it has character."

"That's a polite way of saying 'condemned.'"

She laughed and opened a cabinet. "So. Utensils. I have a pan, a wooden spoon, and—" She held up a cheese grater. "This."

"That'll do."

He unpacked the groceries while she cleared counter space. The kitchen opened to the living room, no walls between them. Coco appeared from somewhere and sat at his feet, tail wagging.

"She remembers you."

"I'm memorable."

"That remains to be seen." Annabelle leaned against the counter, watching him work. "You really know what you're doing."

"Risotto's easy. You just have to pay attention."

He heated the pan, started the shallots. The rhythm came naturally—dice, sauté, deglaze. She handed him things before he asked for them.

"Oh—wait." She disappeared into the living room and returned with a wine bottle. "A client gave me this. Supposed to be really good."

Doogan took it. Woodmark Vineyards, Napa. The label looked expensive but unfamiliar.

"You don't recognize it."

"I'm more of a beer guy."

"Liar. You knew my risotto order at Providence." She found two glasses. "You're full of surprises."

"I contain multitudes."

"You said that at the market."

"Still true."

She opened the bottle and poured. The wine was pale gold, catching the light.

"To coincidences," she said, raising her glass.

"And grocery stores."

They drank. The wine was smooth, it was a chardonay but not a great one.  Doogan might have undersold his wine knowledge a bit. He added rice to the pan, stirred, let it toast.

"This is nice," Annabelle said. "I don't usually—"

"Invite strangers to cook?"

"Trust people this fast." She was closer now, watching him work. "But you don't feel like a stranger."

"That's usually a good thing."

"I think it can be a dangerous thing."

"To danger, then?"

They both raised their glasses and finished the wine in their glasses.  He added stock, stirred, added more. The risotto was coming together—creamy, rich, almost done. Annabelle refilled their glasses.

"You're good at this."

"Cooking?"

"Everything." She set down her glass and turned him toward her. "The talking. The timing.  Is this why all the podcasts rave about more experienced men?"

"Is that another way of saying older?"

"That's not a bad thing."

"It's honest."

She kissed him. Soft at first, then certain. He kissed her back and felt the familiar pull—the moment when the job stopped being a job and became something else.

The risotto could wait.

She led him toward the bedroom. Coco whined from the kitchen.

"She'll survive," Annabelle said giggling as she guided him to her room.

It got dark.  Too dark.

Doogan was awoken by the feeling of someone tapping on his forehead.  Through the dark haze of his vision he did not see the giddy receptionist he was expecting.  Instead, eyes of a very serious man were looking back at him.

"Rough night?" he said, still not smiling as he pointed beside Doogan.

Doogan's vision cleared enough to see what was beside him.

Annabelle. Still. Too still.

Her eyes open. Fixed.

Dead.

"Hands where I can see them," the detective said.
