## Scene 9 — Eddie's House

"—so Baxter, walk me through this one more time because I know you're the genius and I'm just the guy who talks too much but help me understand why you can't just do your thing, you know, the magic computer thing where you hack into systems and pull up files and make databases cry, because Martinez is breathing down our necks, he showed me pictures of you and Abby this morning which means he knows who you are and what you're doing and if we don't figure out what Annabelle was doing at that clinic before he does we're all going down for obstruction or conspiracy or whatever he decides to charge us with, so why can't you just—"

Eddie paced his living room, phone on speaker.

"I—I can't hack a system I can't identify." Baxter's voice came through tinny and nervous. "Clinics don't—they don't post their IT infrastructure on a sign out front, you know? I need software names or vendor information or network architecture or—I mean, right now it's like trying to pick a lock when I don't even know if the building has doors or—"

"Okay but you're Baxter, you hack everything, that's literally your whole thing, I've seen you break into city databases and insurance companies and that time you got into the DMV system which I'm still not sure was legal but—"

"In movies! In—in bad TV shows where the IT guy just types really fast and says 'I'm in,' that's not—that's not real. That's not how any of this works." Baxter was talking faster now, panicked. "I need to know what system they're running before I can even start and clinics don't exactly advertise that so—"

"So you need intel before you can work the magic, got it, makes sense, totally understand, but here's the thing, we're running out of time and if we don't figure out what Annabelle was doing before Martinez does—"

"Then someone has to go inside. Physically. And—and look."

Eddie stopped pacing.

"Go inside."

"Physically walk in, look at the monitors, get me software names or vendor logos or anything on a screen that—that tells me what system they're running so I can actually—"

"Right, okay, I can do that, I'll head over there now, tell them I'm from an insurance company doing a—wait. No. I can't." Eddie started pacing again, faster. "Martinez warned me off. Literally told me to stay away from that place. If I walk back in there asking about computer systems he'll arrest me for obstruction and then we're all screwed, Doogan's screwed, you're screwed, I'm—"

"So you need—you need someone else."

"Yeah. Someone who can walk in, look around, get you what you need without—" Eddie stopped. Stared at the phone. "Baxter."

Silence.

"Baxter, you could—"

"No."

"Hear me out—"

"No no no, absolutely not, I know what you're—the answer is—"

"You're the only one who knows what to look for! You know the systems, the vendors, the software—anyone else I'd have to explain it and hope they get it right and hope they don't screw it up but you already know, you could walk in there, pretend you're IT support, say you're there for a software update or a system check or vendor maintenance, whatever, that happens all the time, right? You just said IT techs do this stuff constantly, so you walk in with a polo shirt and a fake company logo and a lanyard and boom, thirty seconds at a terminal, you're out—"

"I—I can't—you want me to *talk* to people?" Baxter's voice cracked. "Eddie, I can barely order coffee without looking guilty. You want me to walk into a medical clinic and lie to a receptionist and pretend to be someone I'm not? They'll call the cops. They'll call Martinez. He'll—"

"Or you walk in there, you use that massive brain of yours, you remember that IT guys do this every single day and it's completely normal, and in thirty seconds you're out with what we need. Doogan's looking at a murder charge, Baxter. If we don't figure out what Annabelle found—"

"I know, I know that, but I'll get caught, you know I'll—"

Abby walked in from the kitchen, coffee mug in hand.

"Who are you bullying?"

"Baxter." Eddie pointed at the phone. "I'm trying to convince him to impersonate an IT tech and infiltrate the clinic."

Abby stopped. Looked at the phone. Looked at Eddie.

"Baxter. The kid who can't make eye contact with a barista."

"I can hear you," Baxter said, voice small.

"I know, honey, that's why I'm saying it loud enough for you to hear." Abby walked closer. "You're brilliant with computers. Genuinely brilliant. But you're absolutely terrible with people. That's not an insult, that's just—"

"A character flaw." Baxter sounded miserable.

"—an observation. Like saying Eddie talks too much or I spend too much. It's just true."

"I don't talk too much."

Abby looked at Eddie.

"Okay fine I talk too much but that's different, that's a feature, that's my whole thing. Baxter walking into a medical clinic and trying to project confidence and authority is like asking me to shut up for five minutes. Theoretically possible but—"

"I'm still on the line," Baxter said quietly.

"We know." Abby set her mug down. "So here's what you do, Baxter. You walk in there and you do exactly what Eddie said. You impersonate an IT tech."

Silence on the phone.

Eddie stared at her. "Did you not just hear the part where—"

"I heard it. Nervous, uncomfortable with people, looks guilty ordering coffee. All true." Abby picked up her mug again. "Which is exactly why it'll work."

"I don't—I don't understand." Baxter's voice was confused.

"You think IT techs are all smooth-talking confidence machines? Half of them are just as uncomfortable as you are. Probably more. They walk into offices, mumble about firmware updates, avoid eye contact, fix the thing, and leave. That's the job." Abby took a sip of coffee. "You're not pretending to be James Bond infiltrating a secret facility. You're pretending to be a tech support guy who showed up to check on some software issue. You know more about computers than anyone in that clinic. By a lot."

"But I—what if they ask questions I can't—"

"Then you mumble some technical jargon and they'll stop asking. Nobody wants a long explanation from IT." Abby leaned against the couch. "Baxter, you're overthinking this. You walk in with a polo shirt that has some fake company logo on it, you've got a lanyard with a badge, you tell the receptionist you're there to do a routine maintenance check on their practice management software, and when she looks confused—because she will—you ask to see one of the terminals. Thirty seconds looking at a screen and you're out."

"That's... that's really all there is to it?"

"That's all there is to it. IT techs do this every single day. You're just another guy in a polo shirt checking on software. Nobody's going to interrogate you."

Eddie watched his wife work. "So you're saying we dress him up like an IT tech and just... send him in."

"I'm saying I come over to Baxter's place in an hour with everything he needs. Polo shirt, fake company logo, lanyard, badge. We make him look like he belongs there." Abby looked at the phone. "Baxter, you've got a color printer, right? Can you make a badge?"

"I—yeah. I can make a badge. I've got laminating pouches and—"

"Perfect. I'll bring the shirt and the lanyard. You handle the logo and the badge. Make up a company name. Something boring and forgettable. 'MedTech Solutions' or 'Healthcare Systems Support' or whatever sounds real."

From the phone, quieter: "And you really think this'll work?"

"I think you'll walk in there, you'll look like every other uncomfortable IT guy who's ever shown up to fix a computer, and nobody will think twice about it. You'll avoid eye contact, you'll mumble some technical jargon, and they'll point you to a terminal because that's what they always do. You're not robbing a bank. You're just looking at a computer screen."

Silence.

Then: "Okay. Okay, I can—I can do that."

"Of course you can." Abby headed toward the kitchen. "I'll pick up a plain polo shirt on the way over to your place. Navy or black. Medium, right?"

"Medium. Yeah."

"Perfect. You print a company logo patch right now—something generic—and I'll bring fabric adhesive. We stick it on the shirt, add the lanyard and badge you make, and you're done." She paused. "One hour. Have the logo and badge ready."

"Okay. I can—yeah. One hour." Baxter's voice was steadier now. "MedTech Solutions or Healthcare Systems Support?"

"Dealer's choice. Just make it boring."

She disappeared into the kitchen.

Eddie picked up the phone. "You good with this?"

"I—I don't know. Maybe? It sounds less impossible than before, but I'm still the guy who looks guilty ordering a sandwich, so—"

"So you'll look guilty checking on a computer. That's fine. IT guys always look uncomfortable. It's part of the aesthetic." Eddie grinned. "Baxter, you've got this. Abby's right—you know more about computers than everyone in that building combined. You're not faking the knowledge. You're just faking the reason you're there."

"And if they ask questions?"

"You mumble about software patches and security updates and firmware versions until they stop listening. Trust me, nobody wants to hear IT guys explain things. That's your superpower."

Long pause. Then, tentatively: "Okay. I'll do it."

"Atta boy. Abby'll text you when she's on the way over."

Eddie ended the call.

Abby reappeared from the kitchen. "One hour. He'll have the logo and badge ready, I'll bring the shirt and supplies."

"You're really going to turn Baxter into an IT tech."

"I'm going to turn Baxter into exactly what he already is—a computer nerd in a polo shirt." She smiled. "The only difference is this time he's got a reason to be looking at their screens."

Eddie pulled out his phone. Texted Baxter: *You're gonna be great. Just remember—mumble the jargon and avoid eye contact. You're already an expert at both.*

Three dots. Then: *If I get arrested, I'm naming you as an accomplice.*

Eddie grinned.

Fair.
