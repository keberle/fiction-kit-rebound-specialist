## Scene 9 — Eddie's House

"—so I'm telling you, I've been sitting on this for three hours now, running every angle I can think of, which is a lot of angles by the way because I've got a pretty extensive toolkit here, but here's the fundamental problem and I need you to understand this before you start asking me to do magic—"

Eddie had his phone on speaker, pacing the living room. Baxter's voice came through tinny but earnest.

"I can't hack a system I can't identify."

"But you're Baxter. You hack everything."

"In movies. In bad television shows where the IT guy waves his hands and says 'I'm in.' That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works." Baxter's frustration was audible. Rare for him to push back this hard. "Clinics don't post their IT infrastructure on a sign out front. I need software names, vendor information, network architecture, something. Right now I'm trying to break into a building when I don't even know if it has a door or a window or a—"

"Okay, okay, I get it, you need intel before you can work magic, that makes sense, I understand that, but we're running out of time here and Martinez is already breathing down our necks and if we don't figure out what Annabelle was doing at that clinic—"

"Then we need someone to go inside and look."

Eddie stopped pacing. "Go inside."

"Physically. Walk into the building. Look at the monitors. Get me software names, vendor logos, anything I can use to—"

"You want me to just walk into a medical clinic and ask to see their computer system?"

"No. I want *me* to walk in and pretend to be IT support."

Eddie blinked. Looked at his phone like Baxter might be visible through the speaker. "You."

"Me."

"Baxter, no offense, but you get nervous ordering coffee. You want to impersonate an IT tech at a clinic that Martinez just told me is under investigation?"

"I don't get nervous ordering coffee."

"You asked for a 'medium caffeine beverage' last week."

"That's technically accurate."

"It's also technically weird." Eddie resumed pacing. "Look, I appreciate the initiative, I really do, but we need someone who can walk in there, be confident, not immediately look like they're committing a crime—"

"I can do confident."

"Baxter—"

"I've been researching this. IT techs show up unannounced all the time. Software updates, system checks, vendor maintenance. I just need the right uniform, the right jargon, and thirty seconds at a terminal."

Eddie stopped at the window. Stared out at the street. This was a terrible idea. This was also possibly their only idea.

"What kind of uniform?"

"Polo shirt with a fake company logo. Khakis. Lanyard with an ID badge. Generic enough that it doesn't raise questions."

"And you just happen to have all that?"

"I can make it. I've got a color printer and laminating pouches."

Of course he did.

"And the jargon?"

"I speak fluent IT. That's literally my entire skillset."

Fair point.

Eddie heard footsteps behind him. Turned. Abby walked in from the kitchen, coffee mug in hand, silk blouse in champagne, tailored linen pants. She raised an eyebrow.

"Who are you talking to?"

"Baxter. He wants to impersonate an IT tech to get into the clinic."

Abby took a sip of coffee. Looked at Eddie like he'd just suggested setting fire to the house. "Baxter. The kid who can't make eye contact with a barista. That Baxter."

"That's what I said."

From the phone: "I can hear you both."

"I know, honey." Abby walked closer, peering at the phone. "That's why I'm saying it. You're brilliant with computers. You're absolutely terrible with people. You know this. We all know this. It's not an insult, it's just—"

"A character flaw." Baxter's voice was flat.

"—an observation. A fact. Like saying Eddie talks too much or I shop too much. It's just true."

"I don't talk too much," Eddie said.

Abby looked at him.

"Okay, fine, I talk too much. But that's different. That's a feature, not a bug. Baxter walking into a medical clinic and trying to pass as a confident IT professional is like asking me to shut up for five minutes. It's theoretically possible but highly unlikely."

"I'm still on the line."

"We know." Abby sat on the arm of the couch, still holding her coffee. "Baxter, here's the thing. You're good at what you do. Really good. But what you're describing requires a specific skill set that you don't have. You need to walk in there, make small talk with a receptionist, project authority without being aggressive, navigate social dynamics with people who might be suspicious, and do all of that while committing what is technically a crime."

Silence.

Then: "So you're saying I can't do it."

"I'm saying you'd get caught in thirty seconds. And then Martinez would have another reason to dig into our operation, and Doogan would be even more screwed than he already is."

Eddie winced. She wasn't wrong. Baxter was brilliant. Baxter was also the kind of person who looked guilty ordering a sandwich.

"There has to be another way," Eddie said.

"There is." Abby took another sip of coffee. "I go in."

Eddie and Baxter both started talking at once.

"Abby, no, that's—"

"You can't just—"

"—way too dangerous and—"

"—need actual technical knowledge to—"

She waited. Let them run out of steam. Then, calmly: "I walk in. I ask to use the bathroom. While I'm waiting, I make small talk with whoever's at the desk. I ask about their computer system because mine at home keeps crashing and I'm so frustrated with it and do they ever have problems like that, and what do they use, and—"

"And they tell you." Eddie stared at her. "Just like that."

"Just like that. Because I'm not suspicious. I'm not pretending to be IT. I'm just a woman who needs to use a bathroom and happens to be chatty." Abby stood, setting her mug on the side table. "People tell me things. It's a skill."

From the phone: "She's right. That would work."

"Of course it would work." Abby headed for the kitchen. "I'll go this afternoon. Baxter, what specifically do you need?"

"Software names. Vendor logos. Network infrastructure details if you can see them. Anything on the monitors that looks like a system dashboard or admin interface."

"Easy."

Eddie followed her into the kitchen. White quartz counters, brushed nickel fixtures, everything modern and styled. Abby was already pulling out her phone.

"Abby, wait. Martinez literally just told me to stay away from that place. If you show up—"

"He told *you* to stay away. He doesn't know me. And even if he did, what's he going to say? 'That woman used the bathroom and made conversation'? That's not a crime."

"It is if you're doing it to gather intelligence for an investigation."

"Then it's a good thing I'm not investigating anything. I'm just a woman with a small bladder and good social skills." She looked up from her phone. Smiled. That smile that meant she'd already made up her mind and Eddie could either get on board or get out of the way. "Besides, if Baxter tries to do this, he'll get caught. If you try to go back, Martinez will arrest you for obstruction. I'm the only one who can walk in there and walk out without raising suspicion."

Eddie looked at his phone. "Baxter?"

"She's right. I hate that she's right, but she's right."

"Thank you, Baxter." Abby picked up her coffee mug. "See? Even the teenager agrees with me."

"I'm eighteen."

"Exactly." She headed toward the hallway. "I'll change into something more 'I need a bathroom' and less 'I'm casing your clinic,' and then I'll head over. Baxter, I'll text you photos of anything I see."

She disappeared down the hall.

Eddie stood alone in the kitchen. Looked at his phone.

"This is a terrible idea."

"Probably." Baxter's voice was quieter now. "But it's also the only idea that might work. And she's good at this stuff. Better than either of us."

"I know. That's what scares me."

"Eddie?"

"Yeah?"

"If she gets caught—"

"She won't."

"But if she does—"

"She won't, Baxter. She's too smart. Too good. And she's right—Martinez doesn't know her, doesn't have any reason to suspect her." Eddie moved to the window. Watched the street. "But yeah. If something goes wrong, we're both in deep trouble. Her, me, you, Doogan. The whole operation."

"Then let's make sure nothing goes wrong."

"That's the plan."

Eddie ended the call. Stood in the kitchen alone. Fresh flowers on the counter—Abby swapped them out twice a week, kept the place looking perfect. The house was quiet. Too quiet.

Somewhere across town, Doogan was running a scavenger hunt with a bridesmaid who had issues. Somewhere downtown, Martinez was building a case. And somewhere in this house, Abby was changing clothes so she could walk into a medical clinic and commit light espionage.

This was fine.

Everything was fine.

Eddie pulled out his phone. Opened his messages. Typed to Baxter: *If this goes sideways, we never talked about it.*

Three dots appeared. Then: *Agreed. No records. No evidence.*

Eddie pocketed his phone.

Abby emerged from the hallway. Different outfit—simple blouse, jeans, less styled. She looked like someone who might genuinely need to use a bathroom at a strip mall clinic.

"How do I look?"

"Like you're about to commit a felony."

"Perfect." She grabbed her keys from the counter. "I'll text you when I'm done."

"Abby—"

She stopped. Turned.

"Be careful."

"Always am."

She walked out.

Eddie stood in the kitchen. Alone. Listening to the sound of her car starting in the driveway.

This was either going to work perfectly or blow up in all their faces.

He really hoped it was the first one.
