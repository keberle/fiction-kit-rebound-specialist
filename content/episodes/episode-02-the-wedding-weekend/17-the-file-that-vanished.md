## Scene 17 — The File That Vanished

Eddie sprawled across the couch, eyes closed, one arm draped over the back. His breathing had that heavy rhythm of someone drifting but not quite asleep yet.

Abby sat beside him, legs curled under her, phone glowing in her hand. She scrolled through something—furniture, probably. Or shoes. Eddie had stopped asking.

Baxter hunched forward in the chair across from them, laptop perched on the coffee table, fingers moving across keys. The screen cast a blue glow across his face. He'd been at it for hours.

The house was quiet except for the occasional click of keys and Eddie's breathing.

Baxter stopped typing. Leaned closer to the screen.

"Hey." His voice cut through the silence. "This is weird."

Eddie stirred. Opened one eye. "Hmm?"

Abby looked up from her phone immediately. "What'd you find?"

Baxter's eyes stayed locked on the screen. "A file Annabelle flagged. Like... marked for review or something."

"And?" Abby set her phone down.

"And..." Baxter scrolled. "Okay, so there's this note she left. Says the pharmacy called about the wrong name getting called in on a prescription."

Eddie sat up. Rubbed his face. "Wrong name?"

"Yeah. So Annabelle looked up the name—the one the pharmacy called about—and there's no billing records for the prescription. No prescription records either. Just a patient record with almost no information in it."

Abby stood. Walked over to stand behind Baxter's chair. "That's odd."

"Right?" Baxter kept scrolling. "And the prescription was for a serious painkiller. Not like Tylenol. Heavy stuff."

Eddie swung his legs off the couch. "So someone called in a prescription under a fake name?"

"Or the wrong name." Baxter clicked something. "Annabelle flagged it. Wrote 'need to follow up on this' in her notes."

"When?"

Baxter checked the timestamp. "A couple of weeks ago.  Before we were hired."

The room went quiet.

Abby leaned forward. "Can you find other files she flagged?"

"Let me look." Baxter opened a search window. Typed something. Hit enter.

A list populated on screen. Eight files. All marked with Annabelle's notation system—little flags in the metadata, dates, brief notes.

"Okay, so she was looking into—"

The first file disappeared.

Baxter blinked. "What—"

Another file vanished.

"Wait." He clicked on one of the remaining files. Opened it. Started reading.

The file closed itself. Disappeared from the list.

"No no no—" Baxter's fingers flew across the keyboard. He opened another window. Checked something. "Someone else is logged in."

Eddie stood. Walked over. "What?"

"Someone else is in the system right now. Deleting these files."

Abby's hand gripped the back of Baxter's chair. "Can you stop them?"

"I—" Baxter opened another window. Typed commands. The list of flagged files kept shrinking. Seven. Six. Five. "I can't. They've got admin access. I'm just sitting here watching—"

The file he'd been reading—the one about the pharmacy and the wrong name—closed.

Disappeared.

Baxter stared at the screen. "It's gone."

"All of them?" Eddie leaned closer.

Baxter checked. The search results window showed zero files. "Yeah. All of them."

"Can you get them back?"

"No.  They're gone.  Someone is covering their tracks."
