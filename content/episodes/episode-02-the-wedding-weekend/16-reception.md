## Scene 16 — Reception

Terry appeared in a blur of motion. Phone pressed to one ear, hand gesturing commands to an assistant who looked like she'd run through fire if asked. "—no, the orchids go on the *right* side, which is your *left* when facing the aisle—"

Doogan stepped around them. Wedding venue sprawled ahead—white tents, string lights catching the late afternoon sun, ocean glinting beyond the bluffs. Expensive. Tasteful. Exactly what Sylvia would've designed.

He found a seat on the bride's side. Middle row. Good sightline to the altar without being conspicuous.

Cheryl spotted him from the staging area near the entrance. Raised her hand. Mouthed something that looked like "you came."

He smiled.

She gave him a wink.

Terry swept past again. "—if the string quartet doesn't start playing in thirty seconds, I'm going to yank a kazoo out of my ass and start performing without them—"

The ceremony started ten minutes later.

---

Gabby looked beautiful. Brad looked nervous. The officiant spoke about love and commitment and partnership. People cried. Doogan watched Cheryl stand at the altar in her burgundy maid of honor dress, holding Gabby's bouquet, smiling like she meant it.

Maybe she did.

The vows came. The rings. The kiss. Applause rippled through the crowd. Doogan stood with everyone else, clapped along, then filed out toward the reception tent while the wedding party disappeared for photos.

---

The reception tent smelled like fresh flowers and money. White linen tablecloths. Candles everywhere. A full bar staffed by three bartenders in crisp black vests. Live band setting up on a platform near the back. Chefs moved between tables carrying plated dishes that probably cost more than Doogan's monthly rent.

He found his seat. Table near the windows overlooking the bluffs. Place card said "Doogan Andrews" in elegant calligraphy. The seat next to him said "Mrs. Eleanor Whitmore."

An elderly woman appeared before he could read the rest of the card. White hair. Pearl necklace. Smile that suggested she'd taught kindergarten for forty years and remembered every name.

"You must be the handsome young man everyone's been whispering about."

"Doogan."

"Eleanor." She held out a hand. He shook it. "Cheryl's told me all about you."

"Has she?"

"Well, not *all* about you. But enough to make me curious." She set her clutch on the table. "I taught her in third grade. Brilliant girl. Stubborn as a mule. I'm glad she's found someone who can keep up."

"I am not sure anyone can keep up with Cheryl."

Eleanor smiled. "I'm sure you do." She glanced toward the bar. "Would you excuse me? I need something carbonated and non-alcoholic. My doctor says I'm not allowed champagne anymore, but I think he's a killjoy."

"Take your time."

She patted his shoulder and disappeared into the crowd.

Someone slid into her seat.

Doogan turned.

Cheryl smiled. "Should I be jealous?"

"That depends."

"On what?"

"What type of soda she finds."

Cheryl laughed. Soft. Genuine. "I missed you during photos."

"How'd they go?"

"Long. Terry made us pose seventeen different ways. I think Gabby's smile might be permanent now."

"Could be worse."

"Could it?"

"Could've been eighteen."

"Fair point."

Terry materialized beside the table. "Cheryl. Head table. Now. Dinner's starting in two minutes and your mother will have a stroke if you're not in your seat."

Cheryl stood. "Duty calls."

"Apparently."

She touched his shoulder. Squeezed. "Save me a dance later?"

"We'll see.  Eleanor has the inside track on you."

"I'm pretty sure I can take her." She smiled. Disappeared toward the head table.

Eleanor returned thirty seconds later. Reclaimed her seat. "Did I miss anything?"

"Not much."

She set her soda down. "That girl's smitten with you."

"You think so?"

"I taught third grade for forty years. I know infatuation when I see it." Eleanor adjusted her napkin.

---

Dinner came in waves. Soup. Salad. Some kind of fish Doogan couldn't identify. Beef that melted on the fork. Waiters refilled water glasses without being asked. The chefs circulated, checking reactions, adjusting presentations.

Doogan stayed polite. Present. Eleanor told stories about teaching Cheryl in third grade—letting her ability to verbally level any boy in class at the drop of a hat.

"She was trouble," Eleanor said.

"She was...interesting," Doogan said.

"That's what trouble people say." Eleanor smiled. "But you're right. She was brilliant. Still is. Just took her awhile to figure out what to do with it."

The band shifted into something softer. Gabby and Brad beaming with joy. People shifting from table to table.  The usual gentle rumble of a wedding.

Doogan watched the head table. Cheryl sat between Gabby and another bridesmaid, smiling, laughing at something Brad's best man said. She caught Doogan's eye once. Held his gaze for a beat longer than necessary.

Eleanor noticed. "Like I said. Smitten."

---

The bridal party table emptied after dinner. Gabby and Brad made the rounds—thanking guests, hugging relatives, posing for more photos. Cheryl eventually made her way to Doogan's table, hugged Eleanor, then turned to Doogan.

"Still here?"

"Where else would I be?"

"Smart answer." She glanced at Gabby and Brad moving to the next table. "Give me five minutes. I have to do the maid of honor toast thing."

She followed the bride and groom to the next few tables. Doogan watched her work the room—smiling, hugging, laughing at jokes. Natural. Easy. The weight she'd carried all weekend was gone.

---

Terry appeared at the microphone. Tapped it twice. "Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention for just a moment—"

The room quieted.

"We're about to begin the toasts. So if you're holding a glass, refill it. If you're not holding a glass, get one. And if you're thinking about leaving, don't. These are mandatory."

Laughter rippled through the crowd.

Terry gestured toward the head table. "First up—our beautiful bride's father, Thomas Billings."

Thomas stood. Cleared his throat. Delivered exactly the toast Doogan expected—measured, appropriate, heavy on financial metaphors. The crowd clapped politely.

Sylvia went next. Talked about Gabby's childhood. How proud she was. How beautiful the wedding turned out. Terry had to subtly cut her off after five minutes.

Then Terry looked at Cheryl. "And now—our maid of honor, Cheryl Billings."

Cheryl stood. Smoothed her dress. Picked up her champagne flute. Walked to the microphone.

The room watched.

Doogan could see it—the slight tension in people's shoulders. The way Sylvia's smile tightened. The way Thomas shifted in his seat.

They were waiting for the bomb.

Cheryl looked at the crowd. Smiled. "So. I know what you're all thinking."

Silence.

"You're thinking: 'What's Cheryl going to say? Is she going to make this weird? Is she going to bring up something embarrassing? Should we have cut her off at the bar earlier?'" She paused. "And honestly? Fair questions."

Laughter. Nervous at first. Then genuine.

Cheryl's smile softened. "But here's the thing. I'm not here to roast anyone. I'm not here to make this about me. I'm here because Gabby's my sister. And I love her." She looked at Gabby. "Even when she used to steal my clothes. Even when she told Mom I was the one who broke the vase in the hallway—which, for the record, I *wasn't*."

More laughter.

"Gabby and I are different. Always have been. She's the organized one. I'm the one who forgets where she parked. She's the planner. I'm the one who shows up late with wine." Cheryl glanced at Brad. "And Brad? Brad is—" She paused. "Brad is exactly what Gabby needs. Someone steady. Someone kind. Someone who won't judge her when she reorganizes the pantry for the third time in a month."

Brad smiled. Gabby laughed.

Cheryl raised her glass. "So here's to Gabby and Brad. May your life together be full of laughter, adventure, and perfectly organized pantries." She looked at the crowd. "And may Gabby finally stop stealing my clothes."

The room erupted. Applause. Laughter. Glasses raised.

Cheryl returned to the head table. Set her glass down. Hugged Gabby. Said something that made her sister laugh.

Then she looked at Doogan.

Smiled.

Mouthed: "Five minutes."

---

It took fifteen. Cheryl worked through family photos, more hugs, obligatory conversations with aunts and uncles Doogan didn't recognize. He watched from his table. Patient. Eleanor kept up a running commentary about various relatives and their drama.

Finally Cheryl broke free. Crossed the tent. Stopped at Doogan's table. Breathless. Eyes bright.

"Surived," she said relieved.

"You did great."

"I didn't make it weird?"

"You made it perfect."

She exhaled. Looked at the dance floor where Gabby and Brad were spinning through another song. "I think my work here is done." She looked at him. "If you wouldn't mind taking me home."

"Now?"

"Now."

"What about the hokie pokie?"

"Screw the hokie pokie." She grabbed his hand. Pulled him to his feet. "You're coming with me."
