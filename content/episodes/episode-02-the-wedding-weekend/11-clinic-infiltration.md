## Scene 11 — Clinic Infiltration

Eddie noticed it when Baxter crossed the parking lot. Another earpiece. Flesh-toned, invisible, same bone-conduction tech.

"How many of those things does he have?" Eddie leaned forward in the passenger seat. "We need to check the IT expenses again."

Abby gripped the wheel, engine running. "We have bigger problems."

"I'm just saying, those things cost like—"

"Eddie." She didn't look at him. Eyes on Baxter. "Bigger. Problems."

Baxter froze at the clinic entrance. Polo shirt with a fake MedTech Solutions logo. Lanyard with a laminated badge. Clipboard in hand. He looked like every IT contractor who'd ever shown up.

He also looked terrified.

"He's going to throw up." Eddie reached the door handle.

Abby grabbed his wrist. "He's fine."

"He's standing there like he's waiting for permission from the universe."

"He's centering himself. Let him work."

Baxter took a breath. Pulled the door open. Disappeared inside.

Eddie exhaled. "This is a terrible idea."

"This was your idea."

"Which makes it worse. I have terrible ideas all the time. You're supposed to stop me."

"I liked this one." Abby adjusted the rearview mirror. "Simple. Direct. He walks in, gets what he needs, walks out."

"Unless someone asks questions."

"Then he uses jargon and they stop asking. Nobody wants a long explanation from IT."

Eddie tapped the earpiece app. Baxter's audio feed came through—live, real-time, courtesy of the expensive earpiece Eddie was definitely auditing later.

Reception noise. A voice—bored, female, young.

"Can I help you?"

Baxter's voice. Quiet but steady. "Hi, yeah, I'm here from MedTech Solutions. Routine maintenance check on your practice management software. Should only take a few minutes."

"Oh. Um. Nobody told me about that."

"It's automated scheduling. Quarterly check-ins. You probably got an email last week?"

"I don't—I'm just the temp. I started Wednesday."

"No worries. I just need to access one of the terminals. Run diagnostics, make sure everything's up to date. You don't have to do anything."

A pause. Eddie held his breath.

"Okay, yeah, sure. The back office is through there. Nobody's using it right now."

Footsteps. A door opening.

Abby looked at Eddie. "See?"

"He's not out yet."

"He's in. That's the hard part."

Footsteps. A chair scraped. Keyboard sounds.

Baxter's voice, quieter. "I'm at a terminal. Looking at—okay, yeah, they're running MediPro 8.2. Older version but—"

"Don't narrate," Abby said into her phone. "Just get what you need."

"Right. Sorry. I'm—"

A new voice cut through. Sharper.

"Who are you?"

Eddie sat up. "Oh no."

"I'm—MedTech, I'm just—routine check—"

"Doing what? Who authorized you to be back here?"

"The receptionist—she said—"

"I don't care what she said. Out. Now."

Eddie grabbed the door handle. Abby shook her head.

"I'm going, I'm sorry, I thought—"

Footsteps—fast, retreating.

The clinic door opened. Baxter emerged. Walking quickly but not running. Head down. Clipboard clutched like a shield.

He crossed the parking lot. Got to the car. Eddie opened the back door and Baxter fell inside.

"Drive."

Abby pulled out of the spot. Like they were leaving a grocery store.

"You okay?" Eddie twisted around.

Baxter was pale, breathing hard. "I got what we need."

"Who was that?"

"A nurse. Nancy, her badge said. She—she just didn't like me being there. Didn't trust it."

"But you got the software info?"

"MediPro 8.2. Cloud-based." He looked up. "I can work with that. From home."

Abby glanced at Eddie. Eyebrows up. Told you.

Eddie turned back to Baxter. "You did good, kid."

"I thought she was going to call the cops."

"She didn't."

"She wanted to. I could see it. She was deciding whether I was worth the paperwork."

"But you stayed in character. You got out clean." Eddie grinned. "First field op. Not bad."

Baxter leaned his head back against the seat. "I never want to do that again."

"Never say 'never', kid." Eddie smiled.
