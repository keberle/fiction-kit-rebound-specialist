## Scene 13 — Debrief and Dead Ends

"—and the clinic connection's confirmed, we know she worked there for eight months, but beyond that we're hitting walls—"

Eddie paced between the couch and kitchen, drink in hand. Baxter sat hunched at the dining table, laptop open, fingers moving across keys. Abby leaned against the window, arms crossed.

"The background check came back clean," Abby said. "Nothing unusual. Regular life, regular job, no red flags."

"Except the part where she ended up dead." Eddie stopped pacing. "Baxter, Sebastian—anything?"

Baxter stopped typing. "Nothing."

"Nothing? You're the guy who found her tax records in forty minutes."

"That's because she filed them. Sebastian doesn't exist—at least not anywhere I can find. Social media, LinkedIn, business registries, medical billing companies. Without a company name or business ID, I have nothing to search for."

Eddie winced. "Because I didn't get one."

"Yeah." Baxter went back to typing. "It might have helped."

The front door opened. Doogan walked in, still in the country club outfit—polo shirt, khakis, exhaustion visible.

Eddie brightened. "How'd it go?"

"We won. Cheryl's happy." Doogan closed the door, walked to the couch.

"Good. That's—hang on." Eddie gestured at Baxter. "Catch him up on Sebastian."

Baxter looked at Doogan. "He doesn't show up anywhere. No connection to the clinic. Eddie didn't get a company name when you met him, so I can't trace him. He's effectively untraceable."

Doogan sat on the couch. "You think he killed her."

Eddie set his drink down. "I think he paid us to get close to her right before she died. He wanted constant updates, when, where and that just doesn't feel like coincidence."

"Could be."

"It's not."

"What about the clinic?" Doogan looked at Baxter. "Any progress there?"

Baxter's fingers moved across the keyboard. Didn't look up. "I'm in their system. MediPro Online, patient records, billing files. Pretty much what I expected.  Some archived files recently though."

"So they're hiding something."

"Maybe.  I thought medical offices were like data hoarders so I expected more."

"Maybe they had to suddenly clean things up." Abby perked up.

"Oh yeah...I forgot about that.  The clinic.  It got into some trouble.  I found that last night, late.  They were investigated for writing pain killer prescriptions for profit or something.  Looks like they got cleared but they're on file for having been reviewed a year or so ago."

"Seems shady.  Connected to this case?"

"I doubt it since they were cleared before Annabelle even started working there.  But it might explain why I'm not seeing as many patient files or billing records as I expected."

"But nothing to link Annabelle to Sebastian."

"Its not like there's a file titled 'Sebastian' in here.  Its complicated."

Eddie walked to the table. "How complicated?"

Baxter kept typing. "It's not like the movies. Takes time."

Eddie looked at him for a beat. "Yeah. We covered that. Look, sorry. I'm just worried about Doogan. I feel like he's running out time."

"Nah, I've got a couple of hours before I have to pick Cheryl up for the rehearsal dinner."

Baxter looked up.

"Don't get cute.  You know what-"

"Yeah, I do. Just trying to keep it light."

Abby walked him to the door. "We're worried. Martinez is watching you. He's building a case."

"I know."

"So be careful."

"It's a rehearsal dinner."

"Just be Careful."

Doogan smiled. Left.

Eddie watched the door close. Walked back to the table, looked over Baxter's shoulder at the screen—lines of code, database queries, medical billing records.

"How long until you find something?"

Baxter kept typing. "However long it takes."
