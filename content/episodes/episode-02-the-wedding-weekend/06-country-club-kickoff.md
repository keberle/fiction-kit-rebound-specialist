## Scene 6 — Country Club Kickoff

"No no no, that's the *groomsmen* staging area, you're bridesmaids, bridesmaids gather on the east lawn, I literally sent a map, did anyone read the map? Of course you didn't, nobody reads maps anymore, everybody just follows little blue dots on their phones and then acts surprised when they end up at the service entrance—"

The voice hit Doogan before he saw the source. Sharp, rapid-fire, theatrical. He followed it across the Willow Creek Country Club's main patio—white tablecloths, morning sun, the kind of golf course view that came with six-figure memberships.

Terry Tamborino stood at the center of controlled chaos, tablet in one hand, phone in the other, talking to three people at once. Shorter, stocky build, lavender shirt and pressed khakis, theatrical energy in every gesture.

"You." Terry spotted Doogan and pointed. "You're the fix-up date. Doogan Andrews. Come here."

Doogan crossed the patio.

"That's me."

"Thank God. Someone who's actually on time." Terry tapped his tablet. "You're paired with Cheryl for the scavenger hunt. She's—" He looked past Doogan and raised his voice. "Cheryl! Your date's here!"

A woman detached from a cluster of bridesmaids. Late twenties, brunette ponytail, expensive athletic wear. She moved with the posture of someone used to being watched.

"This is him?" She looked Doogan up and down. Not hostile. Assessing. "Family friend?"

"That's what they tell me."

"Funny. I don't remember you from any family functions."

"I'm more of a peripheral friend."

"So a setup." She crossed her arms. "My parents convinced you to keep me company?"

Terry's head snapped up from his tablet. "Cheryl—" He paused. "—your mother thought you two would hit it off. Which, speaking as someone with excellent instincts about these things, you probably will."

Cheryl sighed. "Fine.  But keep up."

"That's the spirit. Now, rules." Terry raised his voice, addressing the full gathering. Two dozen teams spread across the patio—bridesmaids, groomsmen, family members, all holding numbered placards. "First prize is a vintage Birkin handbag that Sylvia is donating from her personal collection and some golf thing...a club maybe. Second prize is public humiliation and my eternal disappointment."

A few nervous laughs.

"The hunt is literature-themed. You'll get clues that lead to locations within walking distance of the club. Each location has an envelope with your next clue. First team back with the golden ticket and the right answer to the challenge, wins. Questions?"

A groomsman raised his hand. "What if we get lost?"

"Then you're not the kind of person who deserves a Birkin handbag." Terry tapped his tablet. "Teams, approach the table for your first clue. Go."

The patio erupted into movement. Doogan and Cheryl reached the table mid-pack. Terry handed them an envelope.

"Try not to overthink it. Sylvia thinks she's being clever." He looked at Cheryl. "And try not to kill anyone. Your mother will never forgive me if someone dies during the scavenger hunt."

"No promises."

Terry moved on to the next team. Cheryl tore open the envelope, pulled out a small card with elegant calligraphy.

"'My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.'" She frowned. "What is that?"

Doogan scanned the line. Something familiar about it, but—

"Any ideas?" Cheryl was watching him now.

Baxter's voice in his ear: "Shakespeare. Sonnet 130. Give me a second."

Doogan kept his expression neutral. "It's Shakespeare."

"Great. I never paid attention in poetry." She looked at the card again. "What does it mean?"

Around them, other teams were already moving. Some jogging toward the parking lot. Others huddled over phones, googling frantically. A bridesmaid named Jillian stood near the table with her boyfriend, both staring at their phones.

Cheryl frowned. "And...?"

Baxter's voice came through fast: "The sonnet mentions roses. 'I have seen roses damasked, red and white.' There's a flower shop called The Rose Shop two blocks south of the club."

"Roses," Doogan said. "The poem mentions roses. Red and white."

"So we need a flower shop?"

"There's one called The Rose Shop. Two blocks south."

Cheryl was already moving. "Let's go."

They jogged across the patio. Other teams scattered in different directions—some toward shops, others toward the main road, one group arguing over a map.

They cut across the parking lot, past luxury sedans and SUVs. The morning air was warm, Santa Ana wind carrying the smell of fresh-cut grass and dry eucalyptus.

Cheryl kept pace easily. Athletic. Competitive. He could see it in her posture—this wasn't just a game. This was something else.

"So what's your deal?" she asked.

"My deal?"

"Family friend my parents set me up with." She glanced at him. "You're either a very good liar or they actually think we'd hit it off."

"Can't it be both?"

She almost smiled. "Fair point."

Behind them, voices. Doogan glanced back. Jillian and her boyfriend, jogging now, phone out, clearly following.

"We've got company," he said.

Cheryl looked back. Her expression hardened. "Of course we do. Jillian can't figure out her own clues so she's following ours."

"Smart strategy."

"It's *cheating*."

"Technically it's just efficient."

"It's Jillian." She picked up the pace. "She's my sister's 'bestie' and the most annoying wannabe influencer in SoCal, which means we need to crush her."

"Crush?"

"Beat her. Destroy her. Make sure she doesn't even get close to that handbag." Cheryl's tone had an edge now. Not playful. Something sharper. "I'm not losing to her. Not today."

Doogan filed that away. Not just competitive. Proving something.

"You really want to win this," Doogan said.

"You have no idea."

Her tone said everything. This felt like it had nothing to do with a handbag.

He kept pace. His legs burned—she was faster than he expected, athletic. The work was familiar, though. Keep someone engaged. Keep someone focused. Keep someone from detonating.

Even if that meant winning a scavenger hunt one literary clue at a time.
