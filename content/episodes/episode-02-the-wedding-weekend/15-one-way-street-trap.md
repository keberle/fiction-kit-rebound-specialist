## Scene 15 — The One-Way Street Trap

"—rehearsal dinner, how'd it go, she fall madly in love with you yet or are we still playing the long game here?"

Eddie's voice crackled through the earpiece. Doogan merged onto the main road, checking the rearview mirror. The sedan was still there. Three cars back.

"It was fine."

"Fine? That's all I get? Come on, Professor, give me something. Did she—"

"I'm being followed."

Silence. Then Baxter's voice, quieter, more focused. "You sure?"

"Dark sedan. Been on me since the restaurant. Staying too far back to make out plates or faces."

"Could be paranoia," Eddie offered.

"Could be."

"But you don't think so."

"No."

More silence. Doogan heard keyboard clicks through the connection. Baxter working.

"Okay," Baxter said. "Head towards old town. About half a mile. There's a one-way street near the older houses in the avenues."

Doogan glanced at the mirror again. The sedan changed lanes when he did. "And?"

"And what?"

"What am I supposed to do with a one-way street?"

"Oh. Right. Sorry." More keyboard clicks. "Make sure they're following you. Duck into the street and park."

"That's it?"

"It's one-way. They can't turn around once they're in. They'll have to drive past you or park."

Eddie laughed. "Where do you get things like this? Doogan, you hearing this? It might work."

"It's a trap."

"Exactly."

Doogan took the next right, heading toward old town. The sedan followed. "They're still with me."

"Good," Baxter said. "Two more blocks, then right. The street's narrow. Older houses. You'll see it."

---

The old town area shifted as Doogan drove. Newer construction gave way to brick facades, narrow sidewalks, streetlights that had been there since the seventies. The one-way street appeared on the right—barely wide enough for two cars, lined with parked vehicles and old storefronts.

Doogan turned in. Drove halfway down the block until he saw the sedan make the same turn. Pulled into an empty space on the right side. Killed the engine.

"I'm parked."

"Now we wait," Baxter said.

"This better work."

"It will. Basic geometry."

Eddie chimed in. "Baxter's geometry. That's what we're betting on."

"Traffic laws," Baxter corrected. "It's a one-way. They can't—"

Headlights appeared to slow as the driver realized what happened.

"They're here," Doogan said.

The sedan slowed. Hesitated. Then committed, rolling forward down the narrow street. Doogan watched in the side mirror. The car approached. Slowed further. Stopped two spaces behind the Cougar.

Engine off. Door opened.

"Got a visual?" Eddie asked.

"Yeah."

The driver stepped out. Average height, compact build, moved with the economy of someone who'd done this before. Streetlight caught his face.

Doogan exhaled. "It's Martinez."

"What?"

"Detective Martinez."

"Oh, come on." Eddie's voice pitched higher. "Are you kidding me? We thought you were being followed by bad guys. Actual bad guys. Not—"

"I'm hanging up," Doogan said.

"Wait, no, we should—"

Doogan tapped the earpiece. Silence.

Martinez walked up to the driver's side window. Stopped. Looked down at Doogan. Waited.

Doogan opened the door. Stepped out. "Detective."

"Mr. Andrews."

"You following me?"

"Yeah." Martinez's face showed nothing. "That's how investigations work."

"That's stalking."

"It's surveillance. Different paperwork."

Doogan leaned against the Cougar. "Can I help you with something?"

Martinez reached into his jacket. Pulled out a folded piece of paper. Unfolded it. Held it up. Photographs. Four of them. Baxter entering the clinic. Abby at the front desk. Eddie on a bench outside.

"Are your friends investigating the clinic?"

Doogan looked at the photos. Looked at Martinez. "Why would they do that?"

"That's what I'm asking you."

"Maybe they needed a doctor."

"At the same clinic where Annabelle Anders worked? The woman whose murder you are a suspect?" Martinez folded the paper. Put it back in his jacket. "That's a hell of a coincidence."

"Life's full of them."

"Not in my experience."

A car turned onto the one-way street next to Martinez's sedan. Slowed. Sat there looking at the two men.

"I think they want your spot," Doogan said.

"In a minute." Martinez stepped closer. "Let me give you some advice. Let the real cops do the work. You and your friends, whatever you're doing, you're going to get in the way. Or worse, you're going to get hurt."

"You think we can't handle ourselves?"

"I think you're civilians playing detective. And I've seen how that ends."

The other car's engine was still running, waiting for the spot to open.

Doogan crossed his arms. "You done?"

"Almost." Martinez's expression shifted. Just slightly. Something that might have been doubt. "Things don't add up with Annabelle Anders. The timeline. The evidence. Some of it doesn't make sense."

"So I'm off the hook?"

"No. You're still the prime suspect. But—" He stopped. Started again. "I'm saying it's not as simple as it looked."

"That supposed to make me feel better?"

"It's supposed to make you stay out of the way. You want to get clear of this?  I have to solve it and your friends playing make believe doesn't help."

The car behind revved their engine. Martinez finally turned. Looked at the driver. Held up a hand. One minute.

Martinez studied him. "You know where I can find you if I have more questions?"

"Apparently, you can just follow me."

"Don't leave town, Mr. Andrews."

"Wasn't planning on it."
