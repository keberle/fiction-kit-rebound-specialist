## Scene 5 — Restaurant Meeting

"So the beauty of this situation, and I mean this sincerely, is that you're getting the absolute best at emotional management during what I understand is a very delicate family moment, and Doogan here has handled situations way more complicated than a wedding weekend, which I'm not saying your wedding is simple, obviously it's the social event of the season, you said that yourself and I believe you, but what I'm saying is he's seen it all, done it all, and you're in excellent hands, Tom."

Eddie was mid-pitch when Thomas Billings spoke up.

"It's Thomas."

Eddie stopped mid-pitch. Blinked. "Sorry?"

"Thomas. Not Tom." His voice was even, controlled. The kind of correction that had been made a thousand times and would be made a thousand more. "I prefer Thomas."

"Right. Thomas. Absolutely." Eddie's smile didn't falter. "My apologies. As I was saying—"

"How much?" Sylvia Billings asked.

She sat next to her husband—perfectly styled blonde hair, tailored dress. Jewelry caught the restaurant's soft lighting when she moved, deliberate sparkle that said *money*.

Eddie paused. Recalibrated. "Well, that depends on the scope—"

"Scope is the weekend. Friday morning through the reception Saturday night. Keep our daughter from making a scene." Thomas folded his hands on the table. "How much?"

Doogan watched them both. Thomas had the posture of someone who'd bought a lot of things in his life and knew exactly what they cost. Sylvia had the expression of someone who'd watched him negotiate those purchases and learned his patterns.

"Let's get through the details and I'll get back to you with an estimate later tonight and that will include expenses, there are always expenses." Eddie said.

Thomas didn't blink. "Fine."  Money wasn't what they were really asking about but details.  This was a legitimacy test and Eddie had passed.

Eddie's smile widened. "Excellent. Now, to clarify the scope you mentioned—when you say 'keep our daughter from making a scene,' what exactly are we talking about?"

Sylvia leaned forward slightly. "Cheryl can be... difficult."

"Difficult how?"

"Competitive." Thomas said it like it was a diagnosis. "Everything's a contest. Everything's about winning."

"And her sister's wedding is—"

"The ultimate competition." Sylvia's tone was careful. Measured. "Cheryl is our older daughter. Gabby's the bride. There's... history."

Doogan spoke for the first time since they'd sat down. "What kind of history?"

Sylvia and Thomas exchanged a look. Brief. Loaded.

"Nothing specific," Thomas said. "Just sibling dynamics. You understand."

"I understand most sibling dynamics don't require hiring outside help."

"Cheryl can be a handful," Sylvia repeated, her voice firmer now. "She's the maid of honor, which means she's involved in every event this weekend. We need someone to keep her focused. Keep her happy. Make sure she doesn't—" She paused, choosing her words carefully. "—overshadow the bride."

"Overshadow how?"

"However she decides to." Thomas's jaw tightened slightly. "Our daughter is brilliant at finding ways to make moments about her. This weekend is about Gabby and Brad. Not Cheryl."

Eddie jumped back in, sensing the tension. "So Doogan's role is basically companionship, right? He's there as Cheryl's plus-one, keeps her engaged, makes sure she's having fun so she doesn't feel the need to create drama—"

"Exactly." Sylvia's shoulders relaxed slightly. "We're not asking you to control her. Just... redirect her."

"Redirect I can do," Doogan said.

"Good." Sylvia pulled out her tablet. Opened what looked like a calendar app. "The weekend starts Friday morning, nine AM, country club. There's a scavenger hunt. Then that evening, the rehearsal dinner."

"A scavenger hunt."

"Sylvia designed it." Thomas suggested this fact was significant. "It's literature-themed. Very clever."

Sylvia's smile was tight. "I have a master's degree in English literature. It seemed appropriate.  Terry will meet you there," Sylvia omas continued, still scrolling through her tablet. "Our wedding planner. He'll brief you on the full itinerary and introduce you to Cheryl."

"And what's my cover story?" Doogan asked.

"Family friend," Sylvia said. "You're Cheryl's date for the weekend. We told her we set her up with someone we thought she'd like. Simple. Clean. Gives you access to everything."

"Does Cheryl know I'm—"

"No." Thomas looked up from his phone. "And she won't. As far as she's concerned, you're just a fix-up who happens to be paying attention to her. Which, knowing my daughter, will be exactly the kind of attention she wants."

Doogan leaned back in his chair. The work was familiar. Keep someone happy. Keep someone distracted. Keep someone from causing problems.

He'd done this a hundred times.

Just usually not the day after being accused of murder.

"Friday morning," he said. "Country club. Nine AM."

"Terry will have your name on the list." Thomas pocketed his phone. "And I will be expecting that estimate this evening." he said looking at Eddie.

"I'll have my assistant get that out ASAP," Eddie said.

Doogan chuckled, knowing Eddie's assistant was his wife and imagining her reaction to that on-the-fly demotion.

Thomas stood. Sylvia followed. They moved with the practiced efficiency of people who'd conducted a lot of transactions at restaurants.

"One more thing," Thomas said, pausing before leaving. "The scavenger hunt is important to Sylvia. Make sure Cheryl takes it seriously."

"I will."

"Good."

They left.

Eddie waited until they were out of earshot before leaning forward. "So that was... interesting."

"They were, the job feels pretty standard for us.  Where are you heading?"

"Meeting Abby and Baxter. We're digging into Annabelle's employment history. Baxter thinks he's found something."

"What kind of something?"

"The kind we discuss later." Eddie stood. Dropped cash on the table for their drinks and snapping a picture of the bill so Abby can add it to the expense reimbursement. "Go home, Doogan. We've got this."
