## Scene 2 — The Walkout

"Told you he'd lawyer up, I said it the second we walked in, guy like that doesn't sit in a holding cell without making a call." Finch said as Martinez was already walking away, down the hall.

Eddie was mid-sentence when Doogan stepped into the hallway. His best friend stood next to a man in a suit that looked like it came from a going-out-of-business sale circa 2003. The man had the posture of someone who billed by the quarter hour and wanted you to know it.

"Doogan Andrews." The man extended his hand like he was serving a subpoena. "Hank Stillman. I'm your attorney."

Doogan shook his hand. "I didn't call an attorney."

Hank Stillman was a heavyset man in an ill-fitting taupe suit and worn black shoes. He was sweating at 9am, which was impressive even in Southern California.

"Eddie called me." Hank pulled a business card from his breast pocket and handed it over with the practiced efficiency of a parking meter dispensing a receipt. "We need to talk. Not here."

Finch approached from the end of the hallway.

Hank raised his voice enough. "My client has nothing further to say at this time."

"Wasn't asking," Finch said.

Eddie stepped in, always the buffer. "Appreciate the professionalism, Detective. We'll be in touch if anything comes up."

Finch's expression didn't shift. "Don't leave town, Mr. Andrews."

"Wasn't planning on it."

"Good."

Hank gestured toward the exit. "Let's go."

They walked down the fluorescent hallway—Hank in front, Eddie beside Doogan, Finch watching from his post. The station smelled like burned coffee and something industrial. Doogan's legs felt uncertain. His shirt still stuck to his back.

Outside, the morning light hit like a slap. Doogan blinked against it.

Hank stopped on the sidewalk. Pulled out a notepad. "Three rules. Don't talk to cops without me. Don't leave the county. Don't do anything stupid."

"Define stupid." Doogan asked.

Hank looked up from his notepad. "Talking to the police without me present. Going near the victim's apartment. Trying to investigate this yourself. Any of those qualify."

Eddie shifted his weight. "He's good at following rules."

"Then this should be easy." Hank clicked his pen. "What matters is what they can prove and what they can't. Right now, they have circumstantial evidence. You were at the scene. You had opportunity. They'll build motive if they can find one. Our job is to make sure their case falls apart before it gets to a jury."

"I didn't do it."

"Good. Let's keep it that way." Hank's tone was flat, transactional. Not reassuring, just matter-of-fact.

"How much is this going to cost?" Doogan asked.

"My retainer is fifteen thousand. That covers initial filings, arraignment if it comes to that, and preliminary hearings. Trial costs more."

Eddie made a noise. "Fifteen—"

Hank held up a hand. "I'm not the cheapest, but I'm available and I know the system. You want a public defender, be my guest. You'll get someone who's handling forty cases and doesn't remember your name."

Doogan looked at Eddie. Eddie's expression said *we'll figure it out*.

"Fine," Doogan said.

"Good." Hank made a note. "I'll need payment within forty-eight hours. After that, we start building your defense. In the meantime, follow the rules I just gave you. Don't talk, don't travel, don't get cute."

He handed Doogan another business card. "My cell's on the back. Call if the police contact you. Call if you remember anything useful. Don't call to chat."

"Wasn't planning on it."

Hank closed his notepad. "Eddie has my information. We'll be in touch."

He walked toward a sedan that looked as tired as his suit. Got in. Drove away.

Eddie waited until the car turned the corner. "So that went well."

"He mentioned money a lot."

"Lawyers do that." Eddie ran his hand through his hair. "We'll cover it. The business has been good. We've got savings."

"I'm not taking your savings."

"You're not taking anything. We're using business funds to handle a business problem. You getting arrested affects all of us."

Doogan leaned against a lamppost. The exhaustion was catching up—bone-deep, the kind that came from adrenaline crashes and fluorescent lights and holding cells with no furniture. His body ached. His mind felt slow.

"Thanks for coming," he said.

"You called me. What else was I going to do?" Eddie's voice had an edge—not anger, just the sound of someone who'd been woken at three in the morning with terrible news. "Got your one phone call and I hear 'I'm in a holding cell, they think I killed someone, get me a lawyer.' So I googled criminal defense attorneys. Hank was the first one who answered at three in the morning. Baxter ran a quick check to make sure he at least passed the bar."

"And did he?"

"Barely, from what Baxter found, but yeah." Eddie shrugged. "Look, he's not great, but he showed up. That counts for something. He'll keep you out of jail while we figure out what actually happened."

Doogan looked at the station behind them. Martinez was visible through the glass doors, talking to another detective. Finch, probably. Comparing notes. Building a case.

"They think I killed her," Doogan said.

"I know."

"I didn't."

"I know that too." Eddie's voice was steady. Certain. "Which is why we're going to figure out who did. But first, you need to sleep. And shower. You look like hell."

"Feel worse."

Eddie pulled his car keys from his pocket. "Come on. Abby's making pancakes."

"It's six in the morning."

"She's been up since three. Figured she'd do something productive." Eddie started walking toward the parking lot. "Besides, pancakes fix most things."

"Not murder charges."

"No," Eddie said. "But they're a start." He unlocked his car. "We'll head to my place first, then I'll take you to get your Cougar. It's still parked near Gelson's, right?"

"Yeah."

"Good. Baxter's got that replacement earpiece situation handled. He'll bring it by your place once you're home."
