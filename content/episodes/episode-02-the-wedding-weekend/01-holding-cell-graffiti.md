## Scene 1 — Holding Cell Graffiti

Two hours in a holding cell and Doogan had memorized the graffiti.

*Julio ♥ Dominique*—carved into cinder block with what looked like a key or maybe a belt buckle. Nice of Julio to declare that.

The holding cell had no furniture. Just walls and floor and the smell of industrial cleaner—ammonia and bleach—trying to kill something older and worse beneath it. Sweat. Piss. The ghost of a thousand bad decisions.

His legs burned. Standing welded his knees together, locked the joints until his thighs trembled with the effort of staying upright. He shifted weight. Left foot. Right foot. The concrete floor radiated cold through his soles.

The door opened.

"Let's go."

Detective Paul Martinez stood in the doorway, notepad already in hand, expression patient. His partner—Detective Peter Finch—lingered behind him, older and harder, wearing his cynicism like a favorite jacket.

Doogan pushed off the wall. Followed them down a fluorescent hallway—lights hummed too loud, high-pitched whine that drilled into his skull. Interview room three doors down. Scarred table. Three metal chairs. One-way mirror reflecting his own face back at him, haggard and gray under the lights.

Martinez sat. Pointed to the chair.

Doogan sat. Cold metal bit through his jeans, shocked his spine. He kept his face still.

Finch leaned against the wall, arms crossed.

"Walk me through the evening," Martinez said.

"Had dinner. Talked. Went to bed. Woke up, she was dead, you showed up."

"From the top. How'd you meet Annabelle Anders?"

"Saturday. Farmer's market."

"Which one?"

"Downtown. The one on Sixth."

"You go there often?"

"First time."

"First time at that market and you just happen to run into her?"

"Her dog found me, actually. White poodle. Very friendly."

Finch straightened off the wall. "So you met the dog first."

"Dogs like me."

"That's convenient." Martinez's voice stayed level. Finch snorted approval.

"You want me to lie and say I'm a cat person?"

Martinez flipped a page. "What'd you talk about?"

"Tomatoes. She thought I was weird for caring about produce."

"Were you?" Finch asked.

"Was I what?"

"Weird about the produce."

"I was shopping. She made it sound weird."

"And after the tomatoes?" Martinez kept his tone level. Conversational. Like they were discussing a grocery list.

"Saw each other again later. Different store. Gelson's."

"Another coincidence."

"Southern California. Everyone shops at Gelson's."

"And that's when you made your move?" Finch's voice had an edge now. "Produce section pickup routine?"

"She invited me to cook dinner. I said yes."

"Just like that."

"Just like that."

Martinez leaned forward slightly. "What'd you make?"

"Risotto. Shrimp."

"Fancy."

"Not really. Risotto's just rice and patience."

"You cook for a lot of women?"

"Some."

"Define 'some.'"

"Enough that I'm good at it. Not so many that I've got a system."

Finch snorted. "Sounds like a system to me."

Doogan met his eyes. "Cooking's not a crime."

"Neither is coincidence." Finch pushed off the wall, moving closer. "Until you stack enough of them together. Then they start looking like a plan."

Martinez cut in before Finch could build momentum. "The dinner. What'd you drink?"

"Wine."

"What kind?"

"White. She had it already."

"Remember the label?"

Doogan tried to pull it up. Exhaustion made his memory fuzzy—edges blurred, details swimming out of focus. "Woodmark something. Custom label. She said a client gave it to her."

Martinez and Finch exchanged a look. Brief. Loaded.

"Client?" Martinez's voice sharpened—first crack in his patient facade. "Annabelle was a receptionist."

"That's what she told me. It's probably still in her kitchen."

"It's not." Martinez replied, slower this time.

Doogan's pulse spiked. Heat flooded his chest. "It's not... there?"

"No idea. Receptionists don't usually get custom-label wine from clients."

"I noticed that too. It's gone?"

Finch leaned in now, hands flat on the table. "You noticed that. But you didn't ask about it?"

"I asked. She said the company rep gave it to her. I let it go."

"Why?"

"Because we were having a nice evening and I didn't want to interrogate her over a bottle of wine."

"Unlike us," Finch said, that wrong smile back.

"Unlike you."

"How much did you drink?" Martinez again, redirecting.

"One bottle between us. Maybe a glass and a half each."

"She open a second bottle?"

"No."

Finch straightened. "You sure about that?  Maybe that bottle disappeared too."

"Yeah, I'm sure. One bottle. White. We didn't finish it."

Martinez pulled out his phone. Swiped. Turned it toward Doogan. A photo of Annabelle's kitchen—clean counters, empty sink. No bottle.

Doogan stared at the photo. His throat tightened. Someone had been in that kitchen. After. While he was unconscious. Moving evidence. "I don't know. It was there."

Martinez took the phone back. Made a note. "What'd you talk about during dinner?"

"Her dog. Her job—briefly. Travel. Nothing heavy."

Doogan lied. He'd asked questions, lots of them. Trying to build the profile he needed for the rebound. But Martinez didn't need to know that.

"She mention anyone at work? Problems? Ex-boyfriends?"

"No."

"Phone calls that night?"

"She checked her phone a couple times. Nothing that seemed off."

"But you noticed."

"I notice things."

"So do we." Finch said it like a threat.

"Bothered you?" Martinez cut in.

"Not enough to say anything."

Finch leaned back against the wall, studying Doogan like a specimen. "So let me get this straight. You meet this woman at a farmer's market—first time you've ever been there. You run into her again at a grocery store. She invites you over. You cook. You drink. You sleep together. And the next morning she's dead. That about cover it?"

Doogan's stomach clenched. "I don't... know."

"Which part?" Martinez sat up straighter.

"I think... I blacked out before anything happened."

The room went still. Not silence. Worse. The kind of quiet that came right before everything broke.

Finch's eyes narrowed. "You know we'll examine the body."

"Please do." Doogan held his gaze. Let him see certainty. Truth.

"And you expect us to believe that's all just bad luck?" Martinez brought the conversation back, voice calm. Reasonable. Dangerous.

"I expect you to do your job and figure out who actually killed her. Because it wasn't me."

"Everyone says that."

"Not everyone wakes up after blacking out, next to a body."

The fluorescent lights buzzed. Doogan's exhaustion was catching up—adrenaline crash from whenever this nightmare had started. Three hours ago? Four?

Martinez stood abruptly. "I'll be right back."

He walked to the door. Knocked twice. It opened. He stepped into the hallway.

Finch stayed put. Eyes on Doogan. Silent now. Letting the quiet do the work.

Doogan leaned back in the chair. Closed his eyes for just a second.

"Tired?" Finch asked.

"Wouldn't you be?"

"Depends. If I'd just strangled someone, I might be pretty wired."

"Good thing I didn't strangle anyone."

"That's your story."

"That's the truth."

"Truth's a funny thing. Means different things to different people."

"Not to me."

"No?" Finch tilted his head. "What's it mean to you?"

"Whatever happened in that apartment while I was unconscious."

"Unconscious. That's an interesting word choice."

"It's the accurate word choice."

"Or the convenient one."

The door opened. Martinez stepped back in, expression different now. Not suspicious. Just neutral. Professional.

"Interview's over."

Doogan blinked. "What?"

"You've got a lawyer. We're done."

"I don't have a lawyer."

"Someone disagrees." Martinez gestured toward the door. "You're free to go. For now. Don't leave town."

Finch pushed off the wall. Moved toward the door. Stopped next to Doogan's chair. Close enough that Doogan could smell coffee and cheap aftershave.

"The guilty ones always have lawyers."

He walked out.

Martinez held the door. Waiting. His face gave away nothing—no sympathy, no suspicion. Just a man doing his job.

Doogan stood. His legs wobbled—barely, just a tremor. He forced them steady.

"Don't make me come looking for you," Martinez said.

"Wasn't planning on it."

"Good."
