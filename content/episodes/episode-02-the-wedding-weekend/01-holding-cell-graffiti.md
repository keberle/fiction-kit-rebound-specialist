## Scene 1 — Holding Cell Graffiti

Two hours in a holding cell and Doogan had memorized the graffiti.

*Julio ♥ Dominique*—carved into cinder block with what looked like a key or maybe a belt buckle. Nice of Julio to declare that. Real romantic. But how was Dominique supposed to see it in here?

The holding cell had no furniture. Just walls and floor and the smell of industrial cleaner trying to kill something older and worse. His legs ached from standing. His shirt stuck to his back where he'd been leaning against concrete.

The door opened.

"Let's go."

Detective Paul Martinez stood in the doorway, notepad already in hand, expression patient. His partner—Detective Peter Finch—lingered behind him, older and harder, wearing his cynicism like a favorite jacket.

Doogan pushed off the wall. Followed them down a fluorescent hallway that hummed too loud. Interview room three doors down. Scarred table. Three metal chairs. One-way mirror that probably had somebody behind it taking notes.

Martinez sat. Gestured at a chair. "Sit."

Doogan sat. The chair was cold through his jeans.

Finch leaned against the wall, arms crossed, already judging.

"Walk me through the evening again," Martinez said.

"We had dinner. Talked. Went to bed. I woke up, she was dead, you were there."

"Let's back up." Martinez's tone stayed level. Almost conversational. "How'd you meet Annabelle Anders?"

"Grocery store. Produce section."

"Which store?"

"I don't remember the name. One on the west side. Near the beach."

Finch straightened off the wall. "You don't remember the store where you met a woman you ended up sleeping with?"

"We ran into each other a few times. First at a farmer's market, then the grocery store. It wasn't one meeting."

"Multiple meetings and you still don't remember where."

"I was buying groceries, not scouting real estate."

Martinez flipped a page in his notepad. Slow. Deliberate. "What'd you talk about at dinner?"

"Food. Travel. Her dog."

"She mention work?"

"In passing."

"Say where?"

"Some medical billing company."

"She give you a name?"

"No."

"You didn't ask?"

"It didn't come up."

Finch made a sound somewhere between a laugh and a snort. "Woman invites you to her place, cooks dinner, spends the evening with you, and you don't ask where she works?"

"I was more interested in her than her résumé."

"That's real touching." Finch's smile had no warmth in it. "Real romantic. Right up until she ends up strangled in her own bed."

Doogan met his eyes. Said nothing.

Martinez cut in, voice still calm. "Any idea who might've wanted to hurt her?"

"No."

"Ex-boyfriend? Someone from work?"

"She didn't mention anyone."

"Phone calls that night? Texts that seemed off?"

"Not that I saw."

"You see her phone at all?"

"Briefly. She checked it a couple times during dinner. Nothing seemed wrong."

Finch stepped closer to the table. "So you're telling me you meet this woman a few times, sleep with her, and know basically nothing about her life. That sound right to you?"

"Sounds like dating."

"Sounds like a story."

"It's what happened."

"What happened," Finch said, leaning forward now, hands flat on the table, "is a woman's dead. Strangled. And the guy in her bed when it happened is sitting here acting like this is just bad timing."

"I'm not acting like anything."

"You're acting like a man with nothing to hide. But you've got no alibi, no witnesses, and no good reason you were there."

"Being invited is a pretty good reason."

"For dinner, maybe. Not for murder."

Martinez held up a hand. Not dramatic. Just enough. "Peter. Let's stay on track."

Finch backed off half a step. Still watching Doogan like something stuck to his shoe.

Martinez pulled out his phone. Swiped. Turned it toward Doogan. A photo of Annabelle's apartment. Kitchen. Wine bottles on the counter.

"The wine you had at dinner—what kind?"

Doogan looked at the image. Two bottles. One red, one white. "We finished the red. She opened the white but barely touched it."

"What kind of white?"

"I don't—" He tried to remember. "Custom label. Woodmark Vineyards, I think."

Martinez and Finch exchanged a look. Brief. Loaded.

"That mean something?" Doogan asked.

"You tell us." Finch crossed his arms again. "You buy that bottle?"

"No. She said a client gave it to her."

Martinez's tone sharpened just slightly. "Client? I thought she was a receptionist."

"That's what she said."

"Receptionists don't usually get wine from clients." Finch was smiling again. Wrong kind of smile. "Unless they're doing more than answering phones."

"I don't know what she did."

"That's becoming a theme with you." Finch leaned against the wall again, studying Doogan. "You don't know much. For a guy who spent the evening with someone, you sure don't know anything useful."

The fluorescent lights buzzed. Doogan's exhaustion was catching up—adrenaline crash from whenever this nightmare had actually started. Three hours ago? Four?

Martinez's phone buzzed. He glanced at it. Stood. "Be right back."

He walked to the door. Knocked twice. It opened. He stepped into the hallway.

Finch stayed put. Eyes on Doogan. Silent now. Letting the quiet do the work.

Doogan leaned back in the chair. Closed his eyes for just a second.

"Tired?" Finch asked.

"Wouldn't you be?"

"Depends. If I'd just strangled someone, I might be pretty wired."

"Good thing I didn't strangle anyone, then."

"That's your story."

"It's the truth."

"Truth's a funny thing. Changes depending on who's telling it."

The door opened. Martinez stepped back in, expression different now. Not suspicious. Just... neutral. Professional.

"Interview's over."

Doogan blinked. "What?"

"You've got a lawyer. We're done here."

"I don't have a lawyer."

"Someone disagrees." Martinez gestured toward the door. "You're free to go. For now. Don't leave town."

Finch pushed off the wall. Moved toward the door. Stopped next to Doogan's chair. Close enough that Doogan could smell coffee and cheap aftershave.

"The guilty ones always have lawyers."

He walked out.

Martinez held the door. Waiting. His face gave away nothing—no sympathy, no suspicion. Just a man doing his job.

Doogan stood. His legs felt uncertain.

"Don't make me come looking for you," Martinez said.

"Wasn't planning on it."

"Good."

Doogan walked past him into the hallway. The fluorescent lights were too bright. Somewhere down the corridor, he heard Eddie's voice mid-sentence, explaining something to someone who probably wasn't listening.

The door clicked shut behind him.
