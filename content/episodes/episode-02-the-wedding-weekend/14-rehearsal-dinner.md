## Scene 14 — Rehearsal Dinner

Cheryl opened the door before he knocked. Smiled. Black dress, simple, elegant. Hair down. Heels that added three inches.

"You're early."

"Traffic was light."

"Liar." She grabbed a clutch from the entry table. "Give me one second."

"You accuse me of that a lot."

She disappeared back inside. Doogan waited on the porch. The house sat in one of Pacific Point's upscale neighborhoods—two stories, perfectly landscaped, the kind of place that whispered money without shouting it. Professional maintenance. Modern lines. More urban professional than suburban family.

Cheryl reappeared. Locked the door behind her. "Ready."

They walked down the path toward the street. She stopped.

"That's your car?"

The Cougar sat at the curb. Faded dark blue old paint catching the evening light. Cracked leather seats visible through the open top.

"Yeah."

"You drive a convertible."

"When the weather's good."

"And when it's bad?"

"I put the top up and hope for the best."

She walked towards it. "What year?"

"1970. Mercury Cougar XR-7."

"It's perfect."

"My friends don't agree."

"Screw your friends.  It's perfectly you. And perfectly Southern California." She looked at him. "I was expecting something boring. A sedan. Maybe a Tesla."

"I had you pegged as a Tesla person."

"I drive a Lexus. But I'd trade it for this in a heartbeat."

Doogan opened the passenger door. "Then off to dinner we go."

They merged onto Pacific Coast Highway twenty minutes later, ocean on the left, golden hour light turning everything warm. Cheryl had her arm along the door, wind catching her hair. She didn't try to fix it.

"This must do great with the ladies" she said, probing.

"I haven't noticed."

"Uh huh..." she smiled, giving a flirty side eye.

Traffic slowed near Malibu. Sunset glowed orange and pink over the water. Cheryl adjusted her clutch on her lap.

"You nervous?" Doogan asked.

"About tonight?"

"The wedding. Tomorrow."

"A little." She looked at the ocean. "It's complicated."

"Most families are."

"Yeah, but—" She stopped. Started again. "Gabby's great. Really. She's my sister and I love her. But this whole thing feels like—"

Doogan waited.

"Like I'm supposed to smile and be happy and not think about—" She shook her head. "Sorry. You don't need to hear this."

"I don't mind."

"You're being nice because my parents asked you to."

The words landed flat. She winced. "That came out wrong."

"It's okay."

"No, it's not. You're here doing a favor for them. Keeping me company. That's all." She looked at the ocean. "You're good at it, though. Making it feel like you actually want to be here."

Doogan glanced at her. "You think I'm faking this?"

"No, I don't." she paused, making eye contact.

The Orchid sat on a cliff in Malibu, all glass and white stone, lights reflecting off the water below. Doogan pulled into the parking lot, found a spot near the entrance.

Jillian and her boyfriend were already heading into the restaurant, she paused and looked back long enough to notice us and judge the car.  Apparently the cougar isn't instagram worthy.

I could feel Cheryl's eyes roll but she shook it off and pulled in close on my elbow, her hands wrapped around my arm like she'd done that a hundred times.  It was nice.

"Let's do this thing!" she proclaimed.

Inside, the rehearsal dinner was already underway. Wedding party clustered at a long table near the windows—Thomas and Sylvia at the head, Gabby and Brad beside them, bridesmaids and groomsmen filling the rest. No empty seats.

Cheryl scanned the room. Gestured toward a small two-top near the back. "Over there."

They wove through tables, past waiters carrying wine and appetizers. Sat. The table had a view of the water, far enough from the wedding party to feel separate.

"You're hiding," Doogan said.

"I'm being strategic." She set her clutch down. "If I sit up there, someone's going to make a toast, and I'm going to have to smile while they talk about how perfect Gabby and Brad are together."

"They're not perfect?"

"They're fine. They're great. I just—" She stopped. Smiled at a passing waiter, declined wine. Waited until he was gone. "Brad was my boyfriend first."

Doogan didn't react. "How long?"

"Six months. Maybe seven. We met at some corporate mixer. Finance people, lawyers, accountants. Very boring. Very safe." She looked at her hands. "I broke up with him. He was—God, he was the most boring human on the planet. Nice. Stable. Good job. But I'd rather watch paint dry than have another conversation about quarterly earnings projections."

"And then?"

"Three months later, he got engaged to Gabby."

The words hung there. Cheryl kept her voice light, but the edge underneath was sharp.

"Betcha' you won't here that story in a toast tonight." she added quickly. "I'm sure she'd say they met some other way, fell in love. That it was different. And maybe it was. Maybe I'm just—"

"Hurt," Doogan said.

"Wounded pride," she corrected. "There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"I dumped him. I don't get to be hurt."

"That's not how feelings work."

She looked at him. "You sound like my therapist."

"Should I be concerned?"

"Probably. She's very good at what she does."

"Then I'll take it as a compliment."

She almost laughed. Shook her head. "This is insane. I shouldn't be telling you this."

"Why not?"

"Because you're—" She gestured vaguely. "I don't know. This guy that I'm trying to get to know and I don't want our time to be about that."

"I'm having a good time."

"At a wedding rehearsal dinner?"

"With you."

A waiter appeared with menus. They ordered. Small talk about the venue, the view, the weather. Cheryl kept glancing at the wedding party table, checking for toasts, but none came.  It was a nice dinner.

Gabby caught Cheryl's eye once. Waved. Cheryl waved back. Smiled.

"She looks happy," Doogan said.

"She is happy." Cheryl turned back to him. "And I'm happy for her. I am. It's just—tomorrow's going to be a lot."

"It's one day."

"A very long day."

"You'll survive it."

"Will I?"

"I'll make sure of it."

The drive back was quieter. Cooler. Cheryl had her arms wrapped around herself, watching the lights of Pacific Point appear on the horizon. Doogan kept the Cougar steady, traffic light, easy ride.

"I'd go just about anywhere with you, Doogan," she said suddenly. "As long as it's in this car."

"Anywhere?"

"Within reason."

"So much for the trip around the world.  What will Jules Verne think?"

"I think he'd recommend against doing it in a convertible from the 70's."

"That's fair."

She laughed. Soft. Genuine. Then quieter. "Thank you. For tonight. For listening."

"Anytime."

"I mean it. You didn't have to—you could've just dropped me off and picked me up later. But you stayed. And you listened. That's—" She stopped. "That's more than most people would do."

Doogan glanced in the rearview mirror. Sedan. Two cars back. Same sedan that had been in the restaurant parking lot. He'd noticed it then. Noticed it now.

"You okay?" Cheryl asked.

"Yeah. Just watching traffic."

"We're almost there."

"I know."

He turned onto her street. Pulled up to the curb in front of her house. The sedan drove past, didn't stop, disappeared around the corner.

Doogan pulled up to the curb, turned off the ignition and walked around to Cheryl's side of the car.

She had started to get the door but caught herself when she realized he was coming around.  "Such a gentleman."

He just smiled and bowed slightly as she rose from the seat and he closed the door behind her.

They walked slowly back to her door.

"It's early."

"Big day tomorrow." Doogan might have gone in normally but the sedan was in his head.

"Right." She nodded. Tried to hide the disappointment. "The wedding."

"You'll be great."

"You sound sure."

"I am. Good night, Cheryl.  I had a nice evening and I'm looking forward to tomorrow."

"Good night, Doogan.  I had a nice evening too."

As he headed to his car, he scanned both sides of the street.  The sedan had found a spot under a tree.  Too dark to see in the windows.  Was it the people who had framed him?
