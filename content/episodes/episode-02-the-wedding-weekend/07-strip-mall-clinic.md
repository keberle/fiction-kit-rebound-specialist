## Scene 7 — Strip Mall Clinic

"So I've been sitting on this bench for twenty minutes memorizing the taco menu and the nail salon lady thinks I'm casing the place."

Eddie shifted on the bench, phone to his ear. Faded stucco strip mall, hand-painted signs, parking lot paint more suggestion than instruction.

Baxter's voice came through tinny. "He lied about where she worked."

"Exactly. Tax records say she worked here. He said she was his receptionist at the medical billing company—"

Movement. Sedan pulling in. Not flashy.

Detective Paul Martinez stepped out.

"Baxter—"

"Why are you whispering?"

"Martinez just showed up." Eddie ended the call. Pocketed his phone. Stood with casual energy. Maybe considering landscape architecture. Definitely not conducting surveillance.

Martinez spotted him before his hand left his pocket. Changed course without breaking stride.

"Mr. Palmer. Right?  You're Mr. Andrews'...what was it?  Manager?"

"Detective Martinez." Eddie smiled. Big. Friendly. Deal-closing smile. "Funny running into you—"

"-at the clinic where murder victims worked."

Eddie's smile held. "Where's Detective Finch? You guys usually—"

"We're not married." Martinez stopped six feet away. "This isn't a buddy cop movie. Real detectives don't ride around doing synchronized head turns. There's a primary. There's a team. Sometimes Finch is with me. Sometimes he's doing actual police work while I explain to civilians why they should stop playing detective."

"I'm not—"

"You're on a stakeout."

"I'm thinking about tacos."

"At ten-thirty in the morning?"

"I plan ahead—"

"You're surveilling a medical clinic." Martinez tilted his head. Not accusatory. Factual. "Where Annabelle Anders worked. Which you somehow knew before I showed up. How did you know she worked here?"

"Doogan's my best friend. He's been accused of murder. I'm trying to understand—"

"By staking out her workplace."

"By figuring out who she was. Where she worked. Who might have—"

"Wanted her dead. Noble friendship. Very touching." Martinez pulled out a notepad. Small. Worn. *I will write down everything you say and use it against you later.* "How did you find this place?"

"Research. Databases, public records—"

"You're a talent manager and sports agent." Martinez flipped a page. "According to your business card, which you gave us at the station earlier this week. With your phone number highlighted. Nice touch. Doesn't explain what you're doing here."

"I'm helping my friend."

"Your friend who woke up next to a body."

"He didn't kill her."

"You playing Hardy Boys isn't going to prove that. It's just going to muddy the water, contaminate leads, make my life harder." Martinez clicked his pen. Once. Twice. Rhythm suggesting he'd had this conversation before. "Annabelle Anders worked here. She had access to patient records, prescription information, controlled substances. You starting to see why her murder might be more complicated than a date gone wrong?"

Eddie felt the ground shift. "Controlled substances."

"Among other things. Which is why I'm giving you free advice." Martinez closed his notepad. "Stop investigating. Go home. Manage some talent. Play golf. Let the real cops do the work."

"Noted."

"We'll see." Martinez pulled open the door. Paused. "For what it's worth, I hope your friend didn't kill her. Makes my job easier. But hope isn't evidence. And you being here—it doesn't help him. It just makes you both look guilty." He walked inside. "Stay out of this."

Eddie waited until the door closed. Called Baxter.

"He showed up because Annabelle worked there."

"I know. Should've warned you. Martinez didn't call anything in—just showed up." Baxter's voice sounded frustrated. "Their digital security is robust for a strip mall urgent care. Proper encryption. Multiple firewalls. Weird."

"How weird?"

"'We're hiding something' weird. Or 'we got breached once' weird. Could go either way."

"Keep digging."

"What about you? Going in?"

Eddie looked at the clinic. Martinez visible through the window, talking to the front desk. "Can't. Martinez just told me to stay out of it. I show up asking questions, he'll arrest me for obstruction."

"So we need another way in."

"Yeah." Eddie started walking toward his car. "We need someone who can get inside without Martinez connecting them to us."
