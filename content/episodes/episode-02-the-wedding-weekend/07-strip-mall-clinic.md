## Scene 7 — Strip Mall Clinic

"So here's what I don't understand, and I've been sitting on this bench for twenty minutes trying to figure it out, which is long enough that I've memorized the menu board at the taco place next door and I'm pretty sure the woman at the nail salon thinks I'm casing the place—"

Eddie shifted on the bench, phone pressed to his ear. The strip mall stretched in front of him—faded stucco, hand-painted signs, parking spaces marked with paint so old it was more suggestion than instruction.

Baxter's voice came through tinny but confident. "You don't understand why he'd lie about where she worked."

"Exactly. That. Because you're telling me Annabelle worked at this clinic, which you pulled from tax records, which means it's real employment, not some side gig or temp thing, but he told us she was his receptionist at the medical billing company."

"She wasn't."

"Which means he lied, which means the whole job was—" Eddie stopped mid-sentence. Movement in his peripheral vision. A sedan pulling into the lot. Not flashy.

Detective Paul Martinez stepped out of the driver's side.

"Baxter, I need to—"

Martinez's door shut. Forty yards away, but closing.

"Why are you whispering?"

"Martinez just showed up."

"The detective investigating—"

Eddie ended the call mid-word. Pocketed his phone. Stood from the bench with the kind of casual energy that suggested he'd just been enjoying the morning air, maybe considering a career in landscape architecture, definitely not conducting surveillance.

Martinez spotted him before his hand left his pocket. Changed trajectory without breaking stride. Hands loose at his sides, expression somewhere between neutral and already tired of this conversation.

"Mr. Palmer."

"Detective Martinez." Eddie smiled. Big. Friendly. The smile that closed deals. "Funny seeing you here. Small town, right? You run into people at the grocery store, the dry cleaner, the—"

"Strip mall medical clinic where murder victims worked."

"—yeah, that." Eddie's smile didn't falter. "Where's Detective Finch? You guys usually travel in pairs, right? Finish each other's sentences, good cop bad cop, the whole—"

"We're not married."

"I'm just saying, on TV—"

"We're not on TV." Martinez stopped six feet away. Close enough to talk. Far enough to observe. "What is it with people and buddy cop movies? I've had this conversation three times this week. Real detectives don't ride around together all day doing synchronized head turns. There's a primary. There's a team. Sometimes Finch is with me. Sometimes he's interviewing witnesses. Sometimes he's doing actual police work while I'm in a parking lot explaining to civilians why they should stop playing detective."

"I'm not playing—"

"You're on a stakeout."

"I'm thinking about tacos."

"At nine-thirty in the morning."

"I like to plan ahead. I'm a planner. I plan things. Lunch, mostly, but also—"

"You're surveilling a medical clinic." Martinez tilted his head slightly. Not accusatory. Just factual. "The medical clinic where Annabelle Anders was employed. Which you somehow knew about before I showed up. Which means you've been investigating. Which means I need to ask you some questions before this gets more complicated than it already is."

Eddie opened his mouth.

Martinez kept going. "And before you tell me you were just asking around, or doing research, or exercising your God-given right to loiter near strip mall taquerías at nine-thirty on a Wednesday morning, let me save us both some time. How did you know she worked here?"

"We—" Eddie stopped. Recalibrated. "Doogan's my best friend. He's been accused of murder. I'm trying to understand what happened."

"By staking out her workplace."

"By trying to figure out who she was. Where she worked. Who might have—"

"Wanted her dead. I get it. Noble friendship. Very touching." Martinez pulled out a notepad. Small. Worn. The kind of prop that said *I will write down everything you say and use it against you later.* "How did you know she worked here?"

"We did some research."

"What kind of research?"

"The usual kind. Databases, public records, the—"

"The usual for who? You're not a detective. You're not a licensed investigator. You're—" Martinez flipped a page. "—a talent manager and sports agent, according to your business card. Which you gave to my partner yesterday. With your phone number highlighted. Which was a nice touch, very professional, but doesn't explain what you're doing here."

"I'm helping my friend."

"Your friend who met a woman at a farmer's market, went on a date, and woke up next to her body."

"He didn't kill her."

"Maybe not. But you playing Hardy Boys isn't going to prove that." Martinez clicked his pen. Once. Twice. A rhythm that suggested he'd had this conversation before and knew how it ended. "It's just going to muddy the water, contaminate leads, and generally make my life harder. Which is already pretty hard, considering I'm investigating a homicide and now I have to explain to my lieutenant why civilians are conducting parallel investigations in broad daylight."

Eddie held up his hands. "I hear you. Loud and clear. Stay out of it. Let the professionals handle it. I'm a huge fan of professionals, by the way, I respect what you do, I respect the process, I'm—"

"Still here."

"—leaving. I'm leaving right now." Eddie took a step toward his car. Stopped. "Although if I were investigating this—hypothetically, which I'm not, but if I were—I'd probably want to know why Annabelle worked at a medical clinic when the guy who hired us said she was his receptionist at a medical billing company. Because that's weird, right? That's the kind of detail that might matter."

Martinez studied him. "Might matter to who?"

"To your investigation."

"My investigation. Which you're not involved in."

"Right. Exactly. Your investigation. Which I fully support from a distance of—" Eddie gestured vaguely. "—several blocks. Minimum."

"Uh-huh." Martinez didn't move. Didn't write anything down. Just watched Eddie with the kind of patience that made you want to confess to crimes you didn't commit. "Annabelle Anders worked at this clinic. She had access to patient records, prescription information, controlled substances. You starting to see why her murder might be more complicated than a date gone wrong?"

Eddie felt the ground shift. Not panic. Just the sudden awareness that he'd been operating with half the information. "Controlled substances."

"Among other things. Which is why I'm going to give you some advice. Free of charge. Pro bono. A gift from the Pacific Point Police Department to civilians with more loyalty than sense." Martinez closed his notepad. Pocketed it. "Stop investigating this. Go home. Manage some talent. Play golf. Do whatever it is sports agents do. Let the real cops do the work."

"I can't do that."

"You can't or you won't?"

"Both." Eddie met his eyes. "Doogan didn't kill her. Which means someone else did. Which means there's a story here that doesn't end with my best friend in prison for something he didn't do. So yeah, I hear you, I respect you, I will absolutely stay out of your way, but I can't just go home and play golf while you investigate him for murder."

Martinez sighed. Small. Almost inaudible. The kind of sigh that said *I knew you were going to say that.* "You know what the problem with civilians is?"

"I'm guessing you're about to tell me."

"They watch too much TV. They think detective work is all clever deductions and dramatic reveals. It's not. It's paperwork and interviews and waiting for forensics. It's boring. It's methodical. It's professional. And it doesn't leave room for well-meaning friends who think they can solve a homicide with Google and good intentions."

"Noted."

"Is it?" Martinez started toward the clinic entrance. Stopped. Looked back. "One more thing. Your friend's hearing device. The one we took when we booked him."

Eddie felt his pulse spike. Kept his face neutral. "What about it?"

"IT guys at the station don't recognize it. They're sending it out for analysis."

"It's a hearing assist device. Japanese company. Very niche."

"Uh-huh. That what Doogan told you?"

"That's what it is."

"We'll see." Martinez pulled open the clinic door. Paused. "For what it's worth, Mr. Palmer, I hope your friend didn't kill her. I really do. Makes my job easier if he didn't. But hope isn't evidence. And you being here, staking out her workplace, investigating on your own—it doesn't help him. It just makes you both look guilty." He walked inside. "Stay out of trouble."

Eddie waited until the door closed. Pulled out his phone. Called Baxter.

"He showed up because Annabelle worked there."

"I know." Baxter's voice sounded frustrated. "I should have warned you. I've been monitoring police dispatch channels but Martinez didn't call anything in. He just... showed up."

"Can you see when he leaves?"

"Not unless I'm physically watching the building, which I'm not, because I'm at home trying to find anything in the clinic's digital footprint that explains why Annabelle worked there when Hank said she was his receptionist. Their security is surprisingly robust for a strip mall urgent care. Proper encryption. Multiple firewalls. It's weird."

"How weird?"

"'We're hiding something' weird. Or 'we got breached once and learned our lesson' weird. Could go either way." Baxter paused. "What do you want me to do?"

"Keep digging. I'll wait until Martinez leaves, then go in and see what I can learn the old-fashioned way."

"Eddie—"

"I know what you're going to say. Martinez just told me to stay out of it. I heard him. I'm choosing to ignore him."

"That's probably a bad idea."

"Probably. But Doogan's under investigation for murder, we've got forty-eight hours before Hank's retainer is due, and we're running out of time to figure out who actually killed Annabelle. So yeah, it's a bad idea. We're doing it anyway."

Baxter was quiet for a moment. Then: "I'll keep working on their system. Let me know what you find inside."

"Thanks, Baxter."

Eddie ended the call. Looked at the clinic. Faded stucco, small sign that read *Pacific Point Urgent Care* in letters that had seen better decades. Martinez was visible through the window, talking to someone at the front desk.

Annabelle had worked here. She'd had access to controlled substances. And now she was dead.

Whatever this place was, it was connected.

Eddie just had to figure out how.

And preferably before Martinez figured out they were still digging.
