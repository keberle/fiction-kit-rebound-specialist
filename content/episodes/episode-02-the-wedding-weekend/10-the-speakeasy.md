## Scene 10 — The Speakeasy

Pride and Prejudice led them to a bookstore. Jules Verne got them to a Travel agency. And now Harper Lee had led them here.  Sylvia's literature degree was working overtime.

"A taco place." Cheryl stared at the storefront. Small, maybe three tables, hand-painted sign. "Prohibition Tacos. How is this related to To Kill a Mockingbird?"

"The 1930s," Doogan said breathless from Cheryl's running pace. "Prohibition era."

"So we just... ask for tacos?"

Baxter's voice crackled in Doogan's ear. "Found it. You have to order tacos.  Looks like...mockingbird?."

"Mockingbird tacos," Doogan said.

Cheryl looked at him. "That's insane."

"So was asking for red and white roses and a trip around the world but here we are."

She pushed through the door. "I wouldn't completely mind a trip around the world."

"Noted." Doogan said, smiling.

The interior smelled like cumin and lime. Clerk behind the counter, teenage kid, bored expression.

"Mockingbird tacos."

The kid gestured toward a door at the back. Plain wood. No sign.

Cheryl stared at Doogan. "How did you—"

"Lucky guess."

Doogan opened the door. Stairs led down. Jazz drifted up—saxophone and piano, scratchy like it came from vinyl.

The space opened at the bottom into a bar. Prohibition-era: dark wood, brass fixtures, vintage gin posters. Leather booths. Maybe a dozen scavenger hunt teams scattered around, looking confused.

Jillian and her boyfriend sat in a corner booth. Champagne flutes. Smug and completely lost.

"How are they always ahead of us?" Cheryl's voice had an edge. "That bitch only works out for gym selfies."

"Speed isn't the same as solving it."

A bartender polished glasses behind the bar. Older guy, fifties, vest and rolled sleeves.

Doogan walked over. Casual.

The bartender looked up. "What can I get you?"

"Information."

"This isn't that kind of bar."

"We're doing the scavenger hunt."

"I figured. You and half my customers today." He gestured at the room. "Golden ticket. Figure out the trick."

Doogan walked back to where Cheryl had taken a table near the bar. Sat down.

"So," she said. "We wait?"

"Something like that."

"Or we ask someone." she said, scanning the room.

"Where's the fun in that?"

She almost smiled. "You're enjoying this."

"Beats most weddings."

"You go to a lot of weddings?"

"Enough."

"Family? Friends?"

"Both. You?"

She tilted her head. "Too many and for all the wrong reasons."

"But you get to do fun things like this."

"This isn't my first one of these but the first one where you needed a literature degree to solve it. Shakespeare. Pride and Prejudice. You knew those right away. How did that-"

"I read."

"Nobody reads that much."

She leaned back. "So what else are you good at?"

"Not much."

"Somehow I doubt that."

"Why?"

"Because you've solved every clue so far without breaking a sweat."

"I had a weird childhood."

"Oh good. A red flag. I was starting to think you were too perfect." She leaned forward, elbows on the table. "What kind of weird?"

Doogan's earpiece crackled. Baxter's voice. "Doogan?"

He tapped his ear once.

Cheryl caught it. "You okay?"

"Just thinking." He kept his voice easy. "What's your favorite book?"

"Nice subject change." she chuckled a little.

"We're doing a literature hunt. Seemed relevant."

"College killed reading for fun." She paused. "What about you?"

"These days? Mostly technical stuff. Boring."

"What kind of technical stuff?"

Doogan's earpiece crackled. Baxter's voice. "Doogan?"

He tapped his ear. "Hold that thought."

Cheryl waved him off. "I'll watch for clues."

He walked toward the back. Found a corner near the restrooms. Tapped his ear.

"What's up?"

"I've got an idea. To Kill a Mockingbird—Atticus Finch doesn't drink. Scout mentions he never touches alcohol."

Background noise—Eddie's voice, muffled. "Are we doing this or not?"

"Where are you?" Doogan kept his voice low.

"I'm in the car with—"

Abby's voice cut through, sharp. "We'll catch you up later, Doogan."

"I don't know if that helps though." Baxter said, fast.

Doogan looked back at the bar. Jillian with her champagne. Other teams ordering, laughing.

"It might.  Good work."

"Really?"

"Really. Go." He ended the connection. Walked back.

Cheryl looked up. "Everything okay?"

"Work thing. Sorted."

"Good." She gestured at the room. "Because I think we're getting closer."

"Yeah?"

"People are starting to look frustrated. We must be missing something obvious." She leaned forward. "What would your weird childhood tell you about this place?"

"I don't have money.  My parents do." she said, smiling. "But I'm thinking I might be missing out on something, sitting here isn't the worst way I can imagine spending an afternoon."

"Its not bad at all."

She almost smiled. "Ugh...here we go again."

Doogan and Cheryl approached the bar. "You two ready to order?" the bartender smiled, wondering if they figured it out.

"Champagne," Cheryl said. "Two glasses."

Doogan held up a hand. "Actually, we're not really drinkers."

The bartender paused. Something shifted in his expression. Recognition. Like he'd been waiting for someone to say exactly that.

"Not drinkers," he repeated.

"No."

He smiled. Reached under the bar. Pulled out two bottles of water. Set them down.

The coaster underneath one bottle was gold. Metallic. Embossed lettering: GOLDEN TICKET.

Cheryl grabbed it. Stared at it. "Are you kidding me?"

"The trick was to not order alcohol." Doogan picked up his bottle.

"But—" She looked at Jillian's table. The champagne flutes. "So everyone else—"

"Got it wrong."

"How did you know?"

"Atticus Finch. The character from To Kill a Mockingbird. He doesn't drink in the book."

She stared at him. "You figured that out from the taco place?"

"I had help."

"Your mysterious phone call."

"Something like that."

She stood. Grabbed the golden ticket. Stared at it. Then at him. "You know what the worst part is?"

"What?"

"I'm actually starting to enjoy this." She headed for the stairs.

He followed. "That doesn't have to be bad."

"It's supposed to be a wedding weekend where I grit my teeth and survive. Not..." She waved the golden ticket. "Not this."

"Not fun?"

She looked back at him. "Exactly. Fun. It's very inconvenient." But she was smiling.

Outside, the sun hit them hard. Bright. Hot. Cheryl blinked against the glare.

Behind them, voices rose from inside. The bartender explaining to another team that champagne wasn't the answer. Jillian's voice, sharp. Confused.

Cheryl looked at the golden ticket in her hand. Then at Doogan. "So you don't actually drink."

"Didn't say that." He smiled. "I said we weren't drinkers. For the puzzle. Atticus Finch didn't drink in the book. That was the trick."

She laughed. "You're kind of a nerd, you know that?"

"I've been called worse."

"I bet you have." She started walking, fast. Competitive energy still buzzing. "Come on. We need to get back before someone else figures it out."

They headed down the street. The country club was a mile away. Maybe more.

"For what it's worth," Doogan said, "this isn't the worst way to spend an afternoon."

She glanced at him. Smiled. "No. It's really not."

They picked up the pace. Running now.

They had the answer. They had the ticket.

And Jillian was still stuck inside with her champagne.
