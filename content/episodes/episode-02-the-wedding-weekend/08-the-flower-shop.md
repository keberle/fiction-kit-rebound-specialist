## Scene 8 — The Flower Shop

The Rose Shop sat between a boutique and a coffee shop, striped awning, window displays full of arrangements. Half a dozen other teams were already clustered around the entrance, arguing over who got to go in first.

"This is going to be a mess," Cheryl said.

"Then we get creative." Doogan walked straight to the door, held it open. "After you."

She went in. He followed. The shop smelled like roses and plant water. A clerk looked up from behind the counter—young, bored, clearly not prepared for the invasion.

"Red roses, please." Cheryl didn't wait. Voice confident, hand gesturing at the display behind the clerk.

The clerk nodded and disappeared into the back.

Doogan caught his breath. His legs burned from the jog—Cheryl set a faster pace than he'd expected. She was in better shape than most people.

Then the door chimed behind them.

Jillian pushed through, boyfriend trailing. Both out of breath, phones out. Athleisure in matching pink—coordinated for content, not comfort.

"Oh my god, Cheryl." Jillian's voice carried that practiced enthusiasm that sounded like a product review. "Are you guys doing the hunt too? That's so fun. We're having *such* a good time."

Cheryl's jaw tightened. "Yep. Having a blast."

"Did you figure out the clue yet? We're still working on ours." Jillian leaned against the counter, angling herself so her boyfriend could get a clear shot of her profile. He was already holding up his phone. "Babe, get the flowers in the background. That's *so* aesthetic."

The boyfriend adjusted his angle. Silent. Obedient.

The clerk returned with a bouquet of red roses. Standard. Beautiful. Wrapped in brown paper.

"Here you go."

Cheryl took them. Looked at Doogan. "Now what?"

He kept his voice neutral. "Ask if there's anything else."

"Anything else?"

"With the roses."

Cheryl turned back to the clerk. "Is there... anything else? With roses?"

The clerk blinked. "Like a card?"

"No. Just..." She looked at the roses. Then at Doogan. Frustrated. "I don't know what I'm asking for."

In his ear, Baxter's voice came through fast. "The sonnet says 'I have seen roses damasked, red and white.' Not just red. Both. Together."

Doogan stepped forward. Casual. Like he was just browsing. "You have white roses too?"

"Sure. You want white instead?"

"No. Red and white. Together."

The clerk paused. Something shifted in her expression. Recognition. "Both colors?"

"Yes."

She smiled. Set down the red bouquet. Reached under the counter.

Jillian leaned forward. "Wait, what are you—"

The clerk pulled out an envelope. Plain white. Sealed. She handed it to Doogan.

"Here you go."

Cheryl grabbed it before he could move. Already tearing it open as she headed for the door. Doogan followed. Behind them, Jillian's voice spiked.

"Wait, how did you—what did he say?"

Outside, Cheryl was reading the card. Her expression shifted. "'It is a truth universally acknowledged...' What is that?"

In his ear: "Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen. First line. There's a bookstore called Chapter & Verse three blocks east."

"Jane Austen," Doogan said. "Pride and Prejudice."

"So we need a bookstore?"

"Chapter & Verse. Three blocks east."

Cheryl was already moving. "Let's go."

The sun felt sharper now. Heat radiating off the pavement. His shirt clung to his back.

"You really want to win this," he said.

"I told you. I'm not losing to Jillian."

"She's just a bridesmaid."

"She's my sister's *best friend*." Cheryl's tone had an edge. Sharp. Personal. "Three months of posting about this wedding like it's *her* big day. Every fitting, every brunch. '#SylviaAndBradForever.' '#BridesmaidGoals.' It's exhausting."

"Sounds like standard social media."

"It's performance. Everything's content. She doesn't have friends, she has followers." Cheryl's pace picked up. "Now she's following us because she can't solve her own clues. Too busy picking her outfit."

Behind them, Jillian and her boyfriend emerged from the flower shop. Phones out. Still filming.

"My parents really did set this up, didn't they?" Cheryl asked.

"Define 'set up.'"

"Hired you. Paid you. Told you to keep me from ruining Gabby's wedding weekend." Her voice had gone flat. Resigned. "It's fine. I get it. I'm the older sister who's still single while the baby sister gets married. I'm supposed to be supportive and gracious and *thrilled* for her. And I am. Mostly. But also..." She trailed off. Shook her head. "Never mind."

"But also it's complicated."

She looked at him. Surprised. "Yeah. It's complicated."

Doogan filed that away. The sister getting married. The older sister who's single. The wedding weekend that required hiring outside help to keep Cheryl from making a scene.

Not just competitive. Wounded.

They picked up the pace. Heading for the bookstore.

Behind them, Jillian and her boyfriend followed.
