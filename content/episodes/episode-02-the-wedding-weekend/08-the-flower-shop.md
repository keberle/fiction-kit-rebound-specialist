## Scene 8 — The Flower Shop

The Rose Shop sat between a boutique and a coffee shop. Striped awning, window displays full of arrangements. They'd outpaced the other teams—no one clustered at the entrance yet.

Doogan held the door. Cheryl went in without slowing.

The shop smelled like roses and plant water. A clerk looked up from behind the counter—young, bored, maybe college student working weekends.

"Red roses, please." Cheryl's voice was confident. Already pointing at the display behind the clerk.

The clerk nodded. Disappeared into the back.

Doogan caught his breath. His legs burned from the sprint—Cheryl set a faster pace than he'd expected. She was in better shape than most people.

The clerk returned with a bouquet of red roses. Standard. Beautiful. Wrapped in brown paper. She set them on the counter.

"Here you go."

Cheryl took them. Looked at Doogan. Waited.

Nothing. No envelope. No clue card.

She paused. Her expression shifted. Something wrong.

She turned back to the clerk. "You know what? Maybe these aren't right."

The clerk blinked. "You don't want them?"

"I'm not sure." Cheryl's voice stayed light. Casual. "Could you put them back? I need a minute."

The clerk took the bouquet. Opened the refrigerated flower case behind the counter. Put them back on the shelf.

Cheryl stepped away from the counter. Doogan followed.

"Maybe the clue's somewhere else in here," she said. Started browsing the displays. Touched a stem. Checked price tags. "Shakespeare mentions roses, right? Maybe we're supposed to find a specific type."

Doogan moved to the window display. "You know your Shakespeare?"

"I know my sonnets." She glanced at him. "Corporate finance requires reading people, not poetry. But I had a good English teacher."

"Let me guess. High school?"

"College. I was a business major but Mom insisted I take some literature." She picked up a card from a display—generic, nothing helpful. Put it back. "You read a lot?"

"When I can."

She smiled. "Careful. You're starting to sound interesting."

"Is that what I'm doing?"

"That's what you *think* you're doing." She moved to another display. Bent to check lower shelves. "But I'm already the smartest person in the room, so you're going to have to try harder."

Doogan almost laughed. "Fair point."

"Besides." She straightened. "You're doing that thing."

"What thing?"

"The thing where you ask just enough to seem interested but not enough to seem nosy." She moved closer to another display. "It's very smooth. Almost makes me think you've done this before."

"Done what?"

She met his eyes. "Charmed someone at a wedding they didn't want to attend."

Doogan held her gaze. "I wasn't looking for anything. I was invited."

"So was I." She turned back to the display. "Doesn't mean we can't have fun with it. Find anything useful?"

"Not yet."

"Then we're wasting time." She checked her phone. "Jillian's probably—"

The door chimed.

Jillian pushed through, boyfriend trailing. Both out of breath, phones out. Athleisure in matching pink—coordinated for content, not comfort.

Cheryl's jaw tightened. "Speaking of."

Jillian didn't acknowledge them. Went straight to the counter. Her voice carried across the shop—that practiced enthusiasm that sounded like a product review.

"Hi! I'll take the red roses, please."

The clerk pulled them back out from the refrigerated case. "These?"

"Perfect. Picture perfect."

The boyfriend held up his phone. Already filming. Jillian angled herself for the best lighting.

The clerk wrapped them. Jillian paid. They headed for the door—roses in hand, clearly confused but committed to the content.

The door chimed as they left.

Doogan watched them go. Something clicked.

In his ear, he said quietly, "Baxter. It's not the red roses. Maybe something else with roses. Check the poem again."

A pause. Then Baxter's voice came through fast. "Wait—'I have seen roses damasked, red and white.' Not just red. Both. Together."

Doogan walked back to the counter.

"Do you have white roses?"

The clerk looked up. "Sure. You want white instead?"

"No. Red and white. Together."

The clerk paused. Something shifted in her expression. Recognition. "Both colors?"

"Yes."

She smiled. Set down her pen. Reached under the counter and pulled out an envelope. Plain white. Sealed.

"Here you go."

Cheryl was already there, taking it before Doogan could move. She tore it open as they headed for the door.

Outside, Jillian and her boyfriend stood on the sidewalk. Staring at their roses. No envelope. No clue. Clearly realizing they'd missed something.

Then Jillian saw them. Saw the card in Cheryl's hand.

Her expression shifted. She grabbed her boyfriend's arm, already turning back toward the shop.

Cheryl read the card aloud as they walked. "'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.'" She frowned. "What is that?"

In his ear: "Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen. First line. There's a bookstore called Longbourn Books three blocks east."

"Pride and Prejudice," Doogan said. "I have an idea. Come on."

He broke into a sprint. Cheryl kept pace easily. Behind them, Jillian and her boyfriend were still at the flower shop entrance, trying to figure out what just happened.
