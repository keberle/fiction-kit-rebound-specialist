## Scene 3 — Eddie's Kitchen

"—so Hank costs money, obviously, lawyers don't work for friendship, which means you need to work, which I know sounds insane considering you were literally arrested this morning but the Billings still want their wedding weekend handled—"

Eddie was mid-sentence when Doogan walked into the kitchen. Abby stood at the stove, flipping pancakes—sharp flips, impatient scrape of spatula against griddle. She didn't turn from the stove.

"Morning, Doogan." Her voice was flat. "Coffee's on the counter. You look like hell."

"Thanks."

"I'm being generous."

Eddie gestured toward the island where a plate of pancakes sat steaming. "Sit. Eat. We've got a situation."

"The situation being I was arrested for murder."

"That situation we're calling 'handled for now.'" Eddie poured himself more coffee. "Hank's on it, you're out, Martinez doesn't have enough yet. The *new* situation is you have a job starting this weekend."

Doogan sat. The pancakes smelled good. He couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten.

"Billings wedding weekend," Eddie continued. "Keep the maid of honor from detonating the 'social wedding of the season.' Her name's Cheryl, older daughter, apparently a landmine waiting to go off—"

"Eddie." Abby's voice was sharp. "He just got out. Give him thirty seconds."

Eddie paused. Looked at Doogan. "You good?"

"I'm good."

"You sure? Because you look—"

"Like hell. Abby mentioned it."

"I was going to say 'tired,' but yeah, also that."

Abby slid a plate in front of Doogan. She set down maple syrup.

Doogan cut into the stack. Took a bite. He barely registered the flavor. His mind was still in that interview room, still hearing Finch's voice.

*The guilty ones always have lawyers.*

"Friday through Sunday," Eddie continued. "Scavenger hunt at the country club, rehearsal dinner, ceremony, reception. Keep Cheryl from making a scene. Cover story is you're a family friend, a fix-up date for the weekend."

"What kind of scene?"

"They didn't specify. Just said she's been 'difficult.'"

"So a babysitting job."

"A *very well-paid* babysitting job." Eddie raised his eyebrows. "Hank wants fifteen thousand within forty-eight hours, and that's just the retainer. If this goes to trial—"

"It won't." Doogan took another bite of pancake. Still couldn't taste it.

Abby pulled out the barstool next to him and sat.

"You don't know that," she said. "Martinez seemed pretty convinced."

"Martinez is doing his job. Finch is an asshole. Neither of them has enough evidence."

"They have you at the scene. They have opportunity. If they find motive—"

"They won't."

"Because there isn't one, or because Hank will make sure they don't find it?"

Doogan looked at her. Abby's eyes were steady, concerned but not pitying.

"Because there isn't one."

She studied him for a moment, then nodded.

Eddie cleared his throat. "The Billings want to meet for dinner later. Wedding planner will introduce you to Cheryl at the first event Friday morning, before the rehearsal."

"And while I'm babysitting a bridesmaid, what are you doing?"

Eddie and Abby exchanged a look. The kind of look that meant they'd already had this conversation and agreed on a plan.

"We're going to figure out what actually happened to Annabelle," Abby said. "Or at least enough to get you cleared."

"Sebastian hired us to rebound her. He's the obvious starting point."

"Which is why we're not starting there." Eddie pushed off the counter. "We start with Annabelle. Who she was, where she worked, who wanted her dead. Sebastian's involved, obviously, but we don't know how yet. We go in asking about him directly, we tip our hand."

"Baxter's already running background checks," Abby added. "Social media, employment history, known associates. We'll find the connection."

Doogan finished the pancakes. Pushed the plate away. The exhaustion was catching up—bone-deep, the kind that came from adrenaline crashes and fluorescent lights and holding cells with graffiti about Julio and Dominique.

"I should get home. Shower."

"Yeah, you really should." Abby's tone was gentle. "You've got the Cougar?"

"Still parked near Gelson's. Where I left it Monday night."

Eddie winced. "Right. When you went to—" He stopped himself. "We'll figure out a ride situation."

"Doogan." Abby waited until he looked at her. "We're going to figure this out. Okay? You didn't do this. We know that. We're going to prove it."

He nodded. Didn't trust himself to say anything.

Abby refilled Doogan's coffee without asking.

"You blacked out," she said quietly.

"Yeah."

"Before anything happened."

"Yeah."

"That's not normal."

"I know."

"The wine."

"Probably."

She wrapped both hands around her mug.

"Eddie's worried," she said. "He's trying to act like it's just another job, but he's worried. He thinks someone set you up."

"Someone did."

"Do you know who?"

"No."

She nodded slowly. "But you have an idea."

Doogan looked at her. Abby was sharp—sharper than she let most people see.

"I have an idea and it starts with our mysterious client."

Eddie appeared in the doorway, phone to his ear. "—yeah the cops took it when they booked him—" He listened. "Perfect. Bring it by his place this afternoon."

He ended the call. "Baxter's got a replacement earpiece. He'll bring it by your place later."

"Good."

"Yeah." Eddie's tone softened. "Look, I know this is a lot. But the Billings job is straightforward. Keep the maid of honor happy, collect the check. You can do this in your sleep."

"I'd prefer to do it awake."

"Then go home, shower, get cleaned up. Baxter will bring the earpiece. We're meeting the Billings for dinner tonight."

Doogan stood. His legs felt uncertain.

"Thanks," he said. "Both of you."

Abby smiled. "That's what family's for. Pancakes and bail money."

"I wasn't actually arrested.  I was taken in for questioning."

"Close enough."

Eddie grabbed his keys from the counter. "Come on. I'll take you to get your car."

Doogan headed for the door. Behind him, he could hear Abby's voice, quieter now.

"You really think he'll be okay for this job?"

"He has to be." Eddie's response was equally quiet. "We need the money. And honestly? Working will be better than sitting around thinking about that interview room."

"He blacked out, Eddie. Someone drugged him and killed a woman while he was unconscious."

"I know."

"And we're sending him right back into the field."

"I know."

A pause.

"He's tougher than he looks," Eddie said finally. "And he's got us. We'll figure this out."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."
