## Scene 3 — Eddie's Kitchen

"So Hank costs money, obviously, guy's a lawyer even if he's a bottom-tier one, and lawyers don't work for free or friendship or any of the things normal humans accept, which means we need money, which means you need to work, which I know sounds insane considering you were literally arrested yesterday but guess what, the Billings still want their wedding weekend handled—"

Eddie was mid-sentence when Doogan walked into the kitchen. Abby stood at the stove, flipping pancakes—sharp flips, impatient scrape of spatula against griddle. She didn't turn from the stove.

"Morning, Doogan." Her voice was flat. "Coffee's on the counter. You look like hell."

"Thanks."

"I'm being generous."

Eddie gestured toward the island where a plate of pancakes sat steaming. "Sit. Eat. We've got a situation."

"The situation being I was arrested for murder."

"That situation we're calling 'handled for now.'" Eddie poured himself more coffee. "Hank's on it, you're out, Martinez doesn't have enough to charge you yet. The *new* situation is that you have a job starting this weekend and we need to make sure you're ready for it."

Doogan sat on one of the barstools. The pancakes smelled good. He couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten.

"Billings wedding weekend," Eddie continued, already moving on to the next thought. "Tom and Sylvia, very wealthy, very concerned about their older daughter Cheryl who is the maid of honor and apparently some kind of emotional landmine waiting to detonate, and they want you to make sure she doesn't ruin their 'social wedding of the season,' which is a direct quote and yes, people actually talk like that when they have that much money—"

"Eddie." Abby's voice was sharp. "He just got out of jail. Give him thirty seconds."

Eddie paused. Looked at Doogan. "You good?"

"I'm good."

"You sure? Because you look—"

"Like hell. Abby mentioned it."

"I was going to say 'tired,' but yeah, also that."

Abby slid a plate in front of Doogan—three perfect pancakes, butter melting into the top one. She set down a bottle of maple syrup that probably cost more than most people's entire breakfast.

Doogan cut into the stack. Took a bite. The pancakes were good—light, slightly sweet, the kind of thing that should taste comforting. He barely registered the flavor. His mind was still in that interview room, still hearing Finch's voice.

*The guilty ones always have lawyers.*

"Cheryl's the maid of honor," Eddie was talking again, leaning against the counter with his coffee. "Her younger sister Gabby is the bride. The wedding's this weekend—ceremony and reception Saturday, brunch the next morning. But there's a full itinerary starting Friday morning with a scavenger hunt at the country club, then the rehearsal dinner that evening. You're supposed to keep Cheryl contained, keep her from making a scene, basically be damage control disguised as a wedding guest."

"What kind of scene?"

"They didn't specify. Just said she's been 'difficult' lately and they need someone to keep her focused and happy."

"So a babysitting job."

"A *very well-paid* babysitting job." Eddie raised his eyebrows. "And before you say anything about taking jobs right now, we need the money. Hank wants fifteen thousand within forty-eight hours, and that's just the retainer. If this goes to trial—"

"It won't." Doogan took another bite of pancake. Still couldn't taste it.

Abby pulled out the barstool next to him and sat. She'd brought her own coffee—something expensive-smelling in a delicate ceramic mug.

"You don't know that," she said. "Eddie said Martinez seemed pretty convinced you were involved."

"Martinez is doing his job. Finch is an asshole. Neither of them has enough evidence."

"They have you at the scene. They have opportunity. If they find motive—"

"They won't."

"Because there isn't one, or because Hank will make sure they don't find it?"

Doogan looked at her. Abby's green-hazel eyes were steady, concerned but not pitying. She was the only person he knew who could needle him about a murder accusation while making pancakes and somehow make both feel like acts of friendship.

"Because there isn't one."

She studied him for a moment, then nodded. Took a sip of her coffee.

Eddie cleared his throat. "So. The Billings. They're expecting you Friday evening for the rehearsal dinner. I told them you'd be there. The wedding planner—Terry someone—will brief you on the full itinerary and introduce you to Cheryl. Your cover story is that you're a family friend, a fix-up date for Cheryl for the weekend. Simple, clean, gives you access to everything."

"And while I'm babysitting a bridesmaid, what are you doing?"

Eddie and Abby exchanged a look. The kind of look that meant they'd already had this conversation and agreed on a plan.

"We're going to figure out what actually happened to Annabelle," Abby said. "Or at least enough to get you cleared."

"Sebastian hired us to rebound her. He's the obvious starting point."

"Which is why we're not starting there." Eddie pushed off the counter. "We start with Annabelle. Who she was, where she worked, who wanted her dead. Sebastian's involved, obviously, but we don't know how yet. We go in asking about him directly, we tip our hand."

"Baxter's already running background checks," Abby added. "Social media, employment history, known associates. We'll find the connection."

Doogan finished the pancakes. Pushed the plate away. The exhaustion was catching up—bone-deep, the kind that came from adrenaline crashes and fluorescent lights and holding cells with graffiti about Julio and Dominique.

"I should get home. Shower."

"Yeah, you really should." Abby's tone was gentle. "You've got the Cougar?"

"Still parked near Gelson's. Where I left it Monday night."

Eddie winced. "Right. When you went to—" He stopped himself. "We'll figure out a ride situation."

"Doogan." Abby waited until Doogan looked at her. "We're going to figure this out. Okay? You didn't do this. We know that. We're going to prove it."

He nodded. Didn't trust himself to say anything.

Eddie's phone buzzed. He pulled it out, glanced at the screen. "Baxter. Give me a second."

He walked toward the kitchen doorway, phone already to his ear. "Hey—yeah, he's here, just got out a couple hours ago—"

Eddie's voice faded as he stepped into the hallway.

Abby refilled Doogan's coffee without asking. Set it in front of him.

"You blacked out," she said quietly.

"Yeah."

"Before anything happened."

"Yeah."

"That's not normal."

"I know."

"The wine."

"Probably."

She wrapped both hands around her mug. Stared at it like it might have answers.

"Eddie's worried," she said. "He's trying to act like it's just another job, but he's worried. He thinks someone set you up."

"Someone did."

"Do you know who?"

"No."

She nodded slowly. "But you have an idea."

Doogan looked at her. Abby was sharp—sharper than she let most people see. She'd figured out their entire operation inside a week when Eddie first brought her into it. She saw patterns where other people saw chaos.

"I have an idea and it starts with our mysterious client." he admitted.

Eddie's voice drifted back from the hallway—louder now, animated. "—no I know but he needs it soon, we've got a job starting this weekend—yeah the cops took it when they booked him, they probably thought it was a hearing aid or something—"

Doogan's attention sharpened. He looked toward the doorway.

Abby caught it. "What?"

Eddie appeared in the kitchen doorway, phone pressed to his ear, gesturing with his free hand in that way he did when he was working through a problem in real-time.

"—so you've got a backup unit, right? I mean you must have a backup, that thing cost a fortune—" He listened. Nodded. "Okay good, yeah, perfect—no no, don't worry about coming here, I'm taking Doogan to get his car in a bit anyway, it's still parked near Gelson's from Monday night—yeah, the whole murder scene situation—"

Doogan felt something settle in his chest. The earpiece. Of course. The cops took it during booking—catalogued it as an unidentified electronic device, probably, thrown it in an evidence bag with his phone and wallet and keys.

He'd been so focused on getting out, on processing the interrogation, on the lawyer and the money and the immediate crisis, that he hadn't even thought about it.

Eddie was still talking. "—yeah he's fine, well not *fine* fine but he's functional, and he's got a wedding weekend gig starting Friday so we need him wired up—so just head over to his place later, he'll be home by then, needs a shower anyway, smells like a police station—yes I know they're expensive, that's why I'm asking if you've got a spare and not if you can magic one out of thin air—"

He paused. Listened. His expression shifted—relief.

"Perfect. Yeah, just bring it by his condo this afternoon. He'll be there." Another pause. "Okay, see you later."

He ended the call. Pocketed the phone.

"Baxter's got a replacement earpiece. He'll bring it by your place this afternoon."

"He had a spare."

"He had a spare. Guy's got like three of them stashed away, apparently. Part of his 'operational readiness protocols.'" Eddie made air quotes. "He's very serious about backup equipment."

"Good."

"Yeah." Eddie's tone softened slightly. "Look, I know this is a lot. Murder accusation, lawyer fees, immediate return to work. But the Billings job is straightforward. Keep the maid of honor happy, don't let her make a scene, collect the check. You can do this in your sleep."

"I'd prefer to do it awake."

"Then go home, shower, shave. Look like a human being who hasn't spent the night in a holding cell. Baxter will get you wired up, I'll call you with the full brief, and you've got a couple days to get your head straight before Friday."

Doogan stood. His legs felt uncertain. The coffee was helping but not enough.

"Thanks," he said. "Both of you."

Abby smiled. "That's what family's for, Andrews. Pancakes and bail money."

"I wasn't actually arrested."

"Close enough."

Eddie grabbed his keys from the counter. "Come on. I'll take you to get your car, then you can head home. Baxter will bring the earpiece by later."

Doogan headed for the door. Behind him, he could hear Abby's voice, quieter now.

"You really think he'll be okay for this job?"

"He has to be." Eddie's response was equally quiet. "We need the money. And honestly? I think working will be better for him than sitting around thinking about that interview room."

"He blacked out, Eddie. Someone drugged him and killed a woman while he was unconscious."

"I know."

"And we're sending him right back into the field."

"I know."

A pause.

"He's tougher than he looks," Eddie said finally. "And he's got us. We'll figure this out."

"You keep saying that."

"Because it's true."
