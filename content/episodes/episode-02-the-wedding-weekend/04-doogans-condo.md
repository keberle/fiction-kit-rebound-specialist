## Scene 4 — Doogan's Condo

Doogan's condo was exactly how he'd left it Monday evening—immaculate, staged, empty.

The shower was hot. He stood under it longer than necessary, letting the water run over him, trying to wash away the smell of industrial cleaner and interrogation rooms and exhaustion.

He'd been in bad situations before. Close calls. Jobs that went sideways. But this was different.

This was someone trying to destroy him.

And whoever it was knew exactly how.

The wine. The blackout. The timing.

Someone had studied him. Learned his patterns. Set him up perfectly.

Sebastian was the obvious answer. But Sebastian didn't have the sophistication for this. Sebastian was a trust-fund kid playing games with other people's lives. He wasn't a strategist.

Which meant someone else was involved.

Someone smarter.

Someone patient.

Doogan turned off the water. Dried off. Got dressed in clean clothes that didn't smell like a police station.

The knock came twenty minutes later. He opened the door to find Baxter standing there—hoodie, sneakers, small equipment case in hand.

"Hey. Eddie said they took your earpiece when they booked you."

"Standard booking procedure, apparently."

"Yeah, well, I've got a replacement." Baxter stepped inside, setting the case on the kitchen island. He opened it—inside, nestled in foam cutouts, were three nearly identical flesh-toned devices. He pulled one out carefully. "This one's calibrated the same as your original. Bone conduction, encrypted channel, battery life is about forty-eight hours continuous."

He handed it over. Doogan took it—barely weighed anything, practically invisible.

"Put it in. I'll run a quick sound check."

Doogan inserted the earpiece. It settled into place like it always did, comfortable and undetectable.

Baxter pulled out his phone, tapped something. "Testing. One two three."

Baxter's voice came through clear, slightly tinny but perfectly audible.

"Good?"

"Good."

"Okay. You're all set." Baxter pocketed his phone. Looked at Doogan with that earnest, analytical expression he always had. "Eddie filled me in. On the arrest. And the job Friday."

"Yeah."

"I'll be monitoring the full time. Anything you need—research, background, tactical support—I'm there."

"Thanks, Baxter."

"Also—" Baxter hesitated. "The one they took. When they booked you. You know they're going to look at it, right? Try to figure out what it is."

Doogan hadn't considered that. "It's not exactly standard consumer electronics."

"No. It's definitely not." Baxter's expression shifted—worried, analytical. "The IT guys at a police station won't recognize it. But if they send it somewhere with better resources, or if Martinez gets curious enough to ask questions..."

"Then I'll deal with it."

"Just—if he asks, it's a custom hearing assist device. Japanese company. Very niche. I can create a paper trail if I need to."

"Baxter."

"Yeah?"

"I'll handle it."

The kid nodded. Packed up his equipment case with careful, precise movements. "Eddie's waiting downstairs. He's got your keys—we grabbed the Cougar on the way here."

"Thanks."

"Get some sleep. This weekend's going to be intense."

Baxter headed for the door, then paused. Turned back.

"Doogan?"

"Yeah?"

"We're going to figure out who did this. Eddie and Abby are already digging into Annabelle's background. We'll find the connection."

"I know."

Baxter nodded once, then left.

Doogan stood alone in his immaculate condo. The city stretched out beyond the windows. His Cougar was parked in the building's garage. The earpiece sat comfortably in his ear. Essential equipment, back in place.

Friday he'd be back on the job and pretending all of this never happened.

And Eddie and Abby would dig into Annabelle's life and figure out who'd set him up.

Simple.

Except nothing about this was simple.

Someone had studied him. Learned his patterns. Engineered a perfect frame.

And somewhere out there, that someone was watching to see if it had worked.
