## Scene 12 — Finish Line

"—and if one more person asks me where the bathroom is, I'm going to have a stroke—"

Terry's voice carried across the country club parking lot. Doogan and Cheryl rounded the hedge wall, both breathing hard. The morning felt like a week ago. Doogan's shirt stuck to his back. Cheryl had stopped trying to fix her hair.

An Uber pulled up to the entrance.

Jillian stepped out. Hair perfect. Makeup fresh. Boyfriend followed, already scrolling his phone.

Cheryl stopped. "No."

"What?"

"They've been using ride share." She pointed at the Uber pulling away. "That's how they kept beating us. They didn't solve anything—they just Ubered between locations."

Doogan watched Jillian adjust her outfit for an invisible camera. "Smart."

"It's cheating."

"It's efficient."

Cheryl turned on him. Eyes bright. "Are you seriously—"

"I'm saying she found the loophole. Doesn't mean she's going to win."

The fight drained out of her. She looked at Jillian again, then shook her head. "You know what? Fine. She can post about it, hashtag it, make a whole TikTok series. We actually solved the clues. That's what matters."

She started walking. Purpose in every step.

Doogan kept pace. "You sure you're done being mad?"

"I was never mad." She glanced at him. "Okay, I was mad. But I'm over it. She's a wannabe influencer with a fake boyfriend and no personality. If cheating at a scavenger hunt makes her feel relevant, that's sad, not threatening."

"Fair."

Terry materialized in front of them. Arms spread like he was stopping traffic. "Looks like Jillian and her, what his name?-doesn't matter-are first. Cheryl and her hunky date are second. Don't see a third place yet but maybe we won't need one," he said winking at Cheryl.

Jillian appeared in the doorway. Held up her own golden ticket. Smiled like she'd already won.

Cheryl's jaw tightened. "Yeah, by cheating."

"We were at the speakeasy too," Jillian called out. "Got the same clue."

"You followed us," Cheryl said.

"We solved it." Jillian examined her nails. "Same result."

Terry looked between them. Grinned. "Well. This should be fun." He gestured toward the entrance. "Inside. Both teams. Let's finish this properly."

The club smelled like old money and furniture polish. Marble floors caught the afternoon light. Other teams clustered near the bar—failed competitors drowning their literary inadequacy in mimosas.

Terry stood at the main desk. Same spot where they'd picked up their first clue that morning. He'd positioned the prizes on the desk—designer handbag, custom golf clubs. Display lighting made them gleam.

Jillian arrived first. Boyfriend trailing behind.

Terry smiled. "Golden ticket?"

Jillian handed it over.

Terry looked at her. "Are you done?"

Jillian spun around. Pulled out her phone. Turned on the camera. Smiled at the lens. "Yes, we're done. We won."

Terry's smile didn't change. "No."

"What?"

"Next team."

Her face went red. She stormed toward the bar. Boyfriend followed.

Doogan watched the whole thing. He and Cheryl stepped up.

Terry's eyes gleamed. "Golden ticket?"

Cheryl handed it over.

Terry flipped it. Showed them the back. "*Quid agis?*"

Doogan noticed the words. Read them aloud. "Quid agis."

Baxter's voice crackled in his ear. "Latin. 'How are you doing?' Checking classical literature—nothing matches this pattern."

Before Cheryl could answer, Doogan touched her arm. "Wait. It's a trick."

"What other types of books does Sylvia read?  Romance?  Mysteries?" he asked quietly. "Besides the classics?"

Cheryl thought. "I don't know.  She's in book clubs but I'm not convinced that's anything but an excuse to drink in the afternoon."

"How about when you were young?  Did she read to you and your sister?"

"Sure.  The usual kid stuff? Those wizard and witch books when I was young."

Baxter's voice came through. "Harry Potter. The Fat Lady. She guards the Gryffindor Tower. You need a password to get in. Say something about the fat lady."

Doogan put it together.

Terry watched them. "Are you done?"

Doogan met his eyes. "Not until the fat lady sings."

Silence.

Terry's face split into a grin. "YES!" He picked up the handbag. Handed it to Cheryl. "We have a winner."

The golf driver came next. Into Doogan's hands.

"Appreciated."

Terry disappeared into a planning whirlwind.

Cheryl stared at the bag. Then at Doogan. "The Fat Lady. From Harry Potter."

"Yeah."

"You got that from 'wizard and witch books'?"

"Close enough."

She shook her head. Smiling. "Thank you. For today."

"It was fun."

"Liar."

"Parts were fun."

"The speakeasy?"

"The speakeasy was good."

"Talking was good."

"That too."

Terry reappeared. Squeezed Cheryl's shoulder. "Rehearsal dinner. Seven o'clock. The Orchid in Malibu." He grinned at Doogan. "Don't be late."

He swept away, already barking orders into his phone.

Cheryl adjusted the handbag on her shoulder. "Seven o'clock."

"I heard."

"I have to run to the rehearsal and then head home to change.  You know, Malibu's forty minutes from here."

"Forty-five with traffic."

She met his eyes. "I could use a ride."

"Yeah?"

"If you're not busy."

"I'm not busy."

"Six thirty. My place."

"I'll be there."
