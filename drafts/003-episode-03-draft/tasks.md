## Notes

**Execution Order:**
1. Draft scenes in story order (T001-T014) to maintain continuity
2. Complete review passes in sequence (T015-T017)

**Scene Length Flexibility:**
- Tournament scenes (T006, T008, T010, T014) may run longer for atmosphere
- Investigation report scenes (T003, T007, T009, T013, T015) can be shorter
- Priority is story quality over strict word count targets

**Voice Reference:**
- Review Episodes 1-2 scenes before drafting to establish voice baseline
- Eddie's motor-mouth is distinctive—don't lose it
- Doogan's short responses contrast with Eddie's verbosity
- Abby's elevated style shows through small details (silk blouses, curated home references)

**Golf Authenticity:**
- Reference real LPGA tournament structures
- Best Ball, Modified Scramble, Exhibition formats must be accurate
- Weather gambit in T014 must be scientifically plausible
- Terminology explained contextually (through Doogan learning caddy role)

**Critical Details:**
- "Nice nails" in T003 must plant detail for T013 payoff
- Martinez earpiece return in T011 references Episode 2 ending
- Nancy introduction in T003 must feel incidental, not sinister
- Mara's arc must progress naturally across all appearances (T004, T006, T008, T010, T012, T014)
