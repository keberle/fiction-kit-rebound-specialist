## Run Log

### December 31, 2025 — Scene 7 Plan Update (Winston Reilly Introduction)

**Type:** Outline revision (planning stage, no prose written yet)

**Changes Made:**

**1. Split former Scene 7 into two scenes:**
   - **New Scene 7:** "The Driving Range / Winston Arrives" (Wednesday morning)
   - **New Scene 8:** "Pro-Am Round 1 / Best Ball" (Wednesday afternoon)

**2. Introduced new character: Winston Reilly**
   - Elderly Black man, late 60s
   - Country club casual attire with golf spikes
   - Uses hand cart (PGA-legal)
   - Frequents nearby 9-hole municipal course
   - Tactical, conservative golfer - short game specialist
   - Recruited by Doogan as Brenda's caddy

**3. Expanded Marcus character:**
   - Initially wears caddy vest with Brenda's name
   - Struggles with weight of golf clubs
   - Relieved when Winston takes over
   - Refocuses on social media content creation role

**4. Strategic storytelling additions:**
   - Doogan demonstrates strategic thinking (several moves ahead)
   - Mara sees Doogan's understanding of golf psychology
   - Winston introduced as "old friend" (they just met - creates subtle tension)
   - Doogan explains philosophy: older golfers need tactics, not power
   - Establishes Winston as perfect match for Brenda's needs

**5. Updated scene numbering:**
   - Former scenes 8-14 → now scenes 9-15 (but scene 14-15 consolidation remained)
   - Final episode count: 14 scenes (same total, just reorganized)

**Element Files Updated:**
- `elements/outlines/episode-03.md` — Updated Scene 7, renumbered subsequent scenes, updated Scene Flow Overview
- `elements/characters.md` — Added Winston Reilly and Marcus detailed entries

**Rationale:**
- Creates moment for Doogan to demonstrate golf knowledge beyond just playing
- Shows Mara recognizing Doogan's strategic mind
- Provides setup for Winston's calm influence on Brenda during tournament
- Gives Marcus more defined role as content creator
- Improves pacing: separates setup (driving range) from execution (tournament round)

**Follow-Up Work Needed:**
- Research PGA caddy vest specifications and details
- Research hand cart regulations for professional tournaments
- Verify municipal course vernacular ("muni track")
- Consider if Winston needs individual character file (currently in characters.md index only)
