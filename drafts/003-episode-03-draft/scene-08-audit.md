## Voice Verification Audit

### Eddie (Via Earpiece)

**Sample:** "—five dealerships, Doogan. Five. And she's got a clean bill of health from her actual doctor, says the prescriptions don't make any sense, she doesn't even need—"

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Motor-mouth energy (mid-sentence opening)
- ✅ Rapid-fire details
- ✅ Cut off mid-thought (Doogan interrupts)
- ✅ Matches Eddie character file voice patterns

### Abby (Via Earpiece)

**Sample:** "Two interviews. Deceased woman's daughter said her mother passed three months ago, pancreatic cancer, moved fast. Dying man I visited this afternoon has maybe weeks left, liver failure. Both of them, minimal records at the clinic. Like someone's trying to hide the fact they're terminal."

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Precise, elevated style
- ✅ Clear reporting structure
- ✅ Professional delivery
- ✅ Analytical observation
- ✅ Matches Abby character file voice patterns

### Doogan

**Sample:** "'Doesn't make sense.'" / "'I don't know.'" / "'This isn't adding up.'" / "'Yeah. Dinner sounds good.'"

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Short responses
- ✅ Measured delivery
- ✅ No rambling
- ✅ Matches Doogan character file voice patterns

### Mara

**Sample:** "'You missed the photo op.' / 'Brenda's a natural. I thought she'd be terrible with press, but she's actually… She makes it fun.' / 'Well. I was hoping you'd say yes.'"

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Warming but professional
- ✅ Slight vulnerability in admission
- ✅ Not overly forward
- ✅ Matches Mara character file (warming from cold)

**✅ All character voices consistent with established patterns**

---

## Tone Verification Audit

### Investigation Thread
- Eddie/Abby updates serious but not melodramatic ✅
- Pattern confusion genuine (healthy over-prescribed vs dying under-recorded) ✅
- Doogan's frustration understated ("doesn't make sense" / "this isn't adding up") ✅

### Job Success Thread
- Mara/Brenda media scene light and celebratory ✅
- Winston's discomfort provides character moment ✅
- Jake's satisfaction subtle (nod, observation) ✅

### Relationship Thread
- Mara's invitation vulnerable but not aggressive ✅
- Doogan recognizes turning point without spelling out ✅
- Button implies complications without stating them ✅

**✅ Tone balanced across three threads**

---

## Structure Verification Audit

### Hook
"—five dealerships, Doogan. Five..."  
**✅ STRONG — Mid-earpiece update, immediate engagement**

### Early Turn
Investigation pattern not making sense  
**✅ EFFECTIVE — Reader sees confusion, dramatic irony (knows more than Doogan)**

### Meanwhile Thread
Mara/Brenda with media while Doogan on call  
**✅ EFFECTIVE — Dual threads balanced, visual contrast**

### Call Ends
Transition from investigation to job  
**✅ SMOOTH — "I gotta go" → Mara approaching**

### Mara Approaches
Dinner invitation conversation  
**✅ NATURAL — Earned through prior scenes' relationship development**

### Late Turn
Mara actively pursuing personal time  
**✅ CLEAR — "Brenda asked" vs "I was hoping" distinction**

### Button
Doogan realizes shift, accepts  
**✅ CLEAN — "The job was working. Too well." + acceptance**

**✅ Scene structure follows synthesis blueprint**
