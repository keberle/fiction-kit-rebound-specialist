- Episode 3, Scene 2: The Clinic Visit ✅ (parallel B-plot, Nancy introduction)

**Continuity Notes Created:**
- Timeline: Sunday afternoon (Scene 1 golf meeting) → Monday evening (Scene 3 gala) = 24-30 hours elapsed
- Doogan's golf game: Played Willow Creek, shot 79, back nine better (figured out wind)
- Auction plan: Jake told Doogan to bid "whatever it takes, three or four thousand"
- Jenny (Mara's regular caddy): Visiting family this week, Jake arranged her absence
- Doogan's cover: Auction winner, enthusiastic fan, NOT professional connection
- Established character knowledge: Doogan knows about Mara from Jake's pitch (technical skill, comeback story, endorsement problem), but must act like casual golf fan
- Secrets: Doogan is PAID by Jake; Mara thinks he's just auction winner

**BEAT MECHANISM VERIFICATION:**

Outline Beat → Verified Mechanism
- "Doogan positioned in back" → HOW? He arrived early, positioned himself strategically (standard Doogan behavior from prior episodes)
- "Jake near bar" → WHY? He's watching to see how introduction goes (established in Scene 1: he's invested in this working)
- "Doogan wins auction at $3,000" → HOW? Jake told him to bid "whatever it takes, three or four thousand" (Scene 1, lines 102-103)
- "Tournament coordinator introduces Doogan to Mara" → HOW? Standard auction procedure (winner meets recipient)
- "Mara paired with Brenda/Marcus" → HOW? Pro-Am tournament pairings announced at gala (standard tournament procedure)
- "Press approaches Mara" → WHY? She's high-profile pro, they're at charity gala (expected media presence)

❓ UNVERIFIED BEATS: None

**FACT REFERENCE TABLE:**

Reference #1: Jake's reaction to $3,000 bid
- Will appear as: Jake comments after Doogan wins
- Source: Scene 1, lines 102-103
- Established detail: "Whatever it takes. Three or four thousand should do it."
- Constraint: Cannot say it exceeded expectations. $3K = low end of range.
- Approved dialogue: "Three thousand. Right on target." OR "That works." OR no comment.

Reference #2: Doogan's recent golf
- Will appear as: Mara asks when he last played
- Source: Scene 1 (Sunday afternoon at Willow Creek)
- Established detail: 14th hole, shot 79, back nine better
- Constraint: If asked "recently?" answer is "This afternoon" (if Scene 3 is Monday late afternoon/early evening, Sunday afternoon = ~24 hours = acceptable as "this afternoon" OR "yesterday")
- Decision: Use "This afternoon" (works if gala is Monday late afternoon/evening)

Reference #3: Mara's regular caddy
- Will appear as: Jake mentions Jenny
- Source: Scene 1, lines 90-93
- Established detail: "I gave Jenny the week off. Paid her full rate anyway."
- Constraint: Keep consistent - Jenny visiting family

❓ MISSING DETAILS - USER INPUT NEEDED:
None. All details for scene exist in source materials.

**SYNTHESIS DOCUMENT CREATED:** ✅
- Blends outline beats with user feedback (brief, don't overplay Mara, Jake as spectator, McDonald style)
- Resolves conflicts (save "Phil Mickelson" line for later, keep Mara reserved)
- Documents core purpose and execution flexibility
