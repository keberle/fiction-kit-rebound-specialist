# Scene 3 — Lessons Learned

## Context

After initial Scene 3 draft, user provided direct rewrite demonstrating proper cinematic opening technique. This document captures key lessons for future scene writing.

## Core Lesson: Describing vs. Being

### The Problem
**AI tendency:** Describe that something is cinematic
**Correct approach:** BE cinematic

### Example

❌ **DESCRIBING (AI error):**
```markdown
The MC had the room eating out of his hand.

"—and that's forty-five thousand dollars for a weekend at the Ritz Carlton..."
```

✅ **BEING (correct):**
```markdown
"—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen, I'll see if I can get an hour driving the ball return cart on the range while Candy is warming up." Harry Halligan said to a captive audience chuckled along.
```

**Key difference:**
- First version TELLS reader "MC had room eating out of his hand"
- Second version SHOWS MC working the room through his actual dialogue
- Reader experiences the charm, doesn't need it explained

---

## Opening Technique: The Em-Dash Cold Open

### The Rule
Open mid-sentence with dialogue already in progress using em-dash (—)

### Why It Works
1. **Immediate immersion** - Reader drops into active scene
2. **No hand-holding** - Trust reader to catch up through context
3. **Energy from line 1** - No slow buildup needed
4. **Cinematic equivalent** - Like starting on Steadicam shot mid-movement

### Application
- Auction scene: "—come on, John..."
- Meeting scene: "—and that's why we need..."
- Argument: "—absolutely not..."
- Phone call: "—hold on, say that again..."

### When NOT to Use
- Quiet intimate scenes may benefit from action beat open
- Some scenes work better with "Doogan crossed the parking lot"
- Use judgment based on scene energy level

---

## Action Beats as Exposition

### The Problem
**AI tendency:** Frontload character descriptions
**Correct approach:** Reveal through action

### Examples

❌ **DESCRIBING:**
```markdown
John Malcolm, a tech CEO in an expensive tailored tuxedo, raised his paddle.
```

✅ **SHOWING:**
```markdown
A man in a tailored tuxedo nodded while holding up his paddle.

"Fifteen! There it is. Connie! Where are you, Connie?"
```

**What the reader learns:**
- There's a man in a tuxedo (visual)
- He's bidding (action)
- His name is John (through MC calling on him)
- His role/status emerges through context (bidding large amounts, MC knows him)

**Key principle:** Let context reveal identity naturally. Don't announce "This is John, he's a tech CEO."

---

## Speaker Tags: Minimal to None

### The Rule
Identify speaker ONCE, then let context carry it

### From Scene 3

```markdown
"—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen, I'll see if I can get an hour driving the ball return cart on the range while Candy is warming up." Harry Halligan said to a captive audience chuckled along.

A man in a tailored tuxedo nodded while holding up his paddle.

"Fifteen! There it is. Connie! Where are you, Connie?"
```

**Speaker tracking:**
- First line: "Harry Halligan said" (identifies him once)
- Next 10+ lines: No tags, just Harry's dialogue
- Context makes it clear MC is speaking
- Reader never confused

**When to re-tag:**
- New character speaks
- After 5+ consecutive untagged lines
- If ambiguity might occur

---

## Trust the Reader

### Core Principle
**Reader is smart. Reader keeps up. Don't explain.**

### Specific Applications

**1. No summaries:**
- ❌ "The MC was working the crowd masterfully"
- ✅ Show the MC working the crowd through dialogue

**2. No explanations:**
- ❌ "Doogan was impressed by the fundraising effort"
- ✅ "Two hundred young women to STEM programs" (reader infers significance)

**3. Context over exposition:**
- ❌ "Melinda Gates, the philanthropist and tech billionaire's ex-wife, sat at a front table"
- ✅ "Melinda Gates at a front table with her bidding card"
  (Reader knows who Melinda Gates is)

**4. Small details reveal character:**
- Golf glove tan line on left hand → Shows Doogan plays golf
- Mara orders sparkling water → Shows discipline (work week)
- No explanation needed for either

---

## Background Activity as Cinematic Atmosphere

### The Sorkin/West Wing Technique

**Structure:**
1. Background event provides anchor (auction running)
2. Foreground action proceeds (Doogan talks to Mara)
3. Background weaves through (MC's voice continues)
4. Multiple layers simultaneously active

### From Scene 3

```markdown
"Seven fifty. Do I hear seven fifty?" Harry continued.

"Whenever possible. Name's Doogan."

"Mara. But you knew that, I think."

"What gave it away?"

"Your left hand is slightly tanner than your right."

Doogan looked his right hand. The golf glove. "Gotcha."

"One thousand. Come on, Mark. You know your table would love the champagne upgrade."
```

**What's happening:**
- Background: Harry runs auction (champagne upgrade lot)
- Foreground: Doogan/Mara meet at bar
- Seamless weave: Harry's voice punctuates their conversation
- Environment breathes with life
- Reader tracks both threads easily

**Key:** Don't stop to explain layering. Just do it. Reader keeps up.

## Meetings Feel Accidental

### The Problem
**AI tendency:** Stage meetings explicitly
**Correct approach:** Natural convergence

### From Scene 3

**Setup:**
```markdown
Mara excused herself from her table and headed over to the bar.
```

**Meeting:**
```markdown
Doogan made his move.

"Can I buy the lady a drink?"
```

**What's NOT there:**
- ❌ "Doogan decided to approach Mara"
- ❌ "He thought this was a good opportunity"
- ❌ "Waiting until she was alone"
- ❌ Any internal decision-making process

**Just action:**
- She goes to bar (for drink)
- He follows (action)
- Conversation begins (immediate)

**Second meeting (later in scene):**
```markdown
Mara got up from her table, make eye contact with Doogan and made her way to the bar. Doogan took the hint.
```

**What's NOT there:**
- ❌ "She wanted to talk to him again"
- ❌ "Doogan realized she was signaling him"
- ❌ Explanation of the eye contact

**Just show:**
- Eye contact (signal)
- Movement to bar (action)
- "Doogan took the hint" (minimal interpretation, immediate action)

---

## Dialogue Efficiency

### Keep Exchanges Brief and Punchy

**From Scene 3:**

```markdown
"Can I buy the lady a drink?"

"Just sparkling water. This is a work week for me. And its a hosted bar."

"I was kind of hoping you'd maybe missed that last detail."

"Quite the gentleman."
```

**4 lines, complete exchange:**
- Doogan's approach (charming)
- Mara's response (practical, calls out the obvious)
- Doogan's comeback (self-aware humor)
- Mara's reaction (amused)

**Character establishment through economy:**
- Doogan: Smooth but not slick, self-deprecating
- Mara: Sharp, observant, professional focus

**No additional explanation needed.**

---

## Specific Detail Over General Description

### The Rule
One specific detail > five general descriptions

### Examples from Scene 3

**Golf glove tan:**
```markdown
"Your left hand is slightly tanner than your right."

Doogan looked his right hand. The golf glove. "Gotcha."
```

**What this accomplishes:**
- Proves Doogan plays golf (no need to state it)
- Shows Mara's observational skills
- Creates character moment
- Small, specific, memorable

**Dress with slit:**
```markdown
...an attractive blonde girl, wearing a dress slit entirely too far up one side walked out with two bottles of champagne...

Doogan glanced over to see Mara roll her eyes.
```

**What this accomplishes:**
- Characterizes Candy (uses appearance strategically)
- Shows Mara's reaction (professional disdain)
- Establishes contrast between Candy and Mara
- All through one detail (slit) and one reaction (eye roll)

---

## Tight Scene Boundaries

### The Problem
**AI tendency:** Continue past the natural ending
**Correct approach:** Hard stop at the button

### From Scene 3

**Final lines:**
```markdown
"Don't worry. I'm a professional too, Jake."

---
```

**What's NOT there:**
- ❌ Doogan walking away
- ❌ Doogan thinking about the evening
- ❌ Description of Jake's reaction
- ❌ Setup for next day
- ❌ Any epilogue

**Just stop.**

Button delivered → Scene ends → Next scene handles what comes next

3. **Both files now emphasize:**
   - BE cinematic, don't DESCRIBE cinematic
   - Trust reader to keep up
   - Show through action, not description
   - Open mid-action with em-dash preferred
   - Background activity as atmosphere
   - Meetings through natural convergence
   - One specific detail > general description
   - Hard stop at scene button

---

## Application to Future Scenes

### Pre-Writing Question
"Am I about to DESCRIBE something being good, or am I going to BE good?"

### During Writing
- Cut any line that explains what just happened
- Cut any line that tells reader how to feel
- Trust specific actions/dialogue to carry meaning
- Open with voice/action, not setup

### Scene Opening Checklist
- [ ] Does it start mid-action or mid-sentence?
- [ ] Am I explaining who's speaking or showing through context?
- [ ] Have I cut all atmospheric setup?
- [ ] Can reader immediately engage without hand-holding?

### Scene Ending Checklist
- [ ] Did I stop at the button?
- [ ] Did I cut reflection/processing/goodbye choreography?
- [ ] Would cutting the last 50 words hurt the scene? (If no, cut them)

## Key Takeaway

**The difference between AI writing and human writing:**

AI describes the effect it wants to create.
Humans create the effect directly.

**Apply to every line:**
- Not "The MC was charismatic" → Show the charm through dialogue
- Not "Doogan was intrigued" → Show through behavior
- Not "The room was energetic" → Use Sorkin layering technique

**Trust your tools:**
- Dialogue
- Action beats
- Specific details
- Reader intelligence

**Cut everything else.**
