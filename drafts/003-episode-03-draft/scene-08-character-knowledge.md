## Validation Checklist for Scene 8

### Pre-Writing Questions

**For EVERY detail Doogan mentions:**
1. [ ] When did Doogan learn this? (Scene #)
2. [ ] Source: Direct experience, team briefing, or character file background?
3. [ ] Can I cite exact source?

**For EVERY detail Mara mentions:**
1. [ ] When did Mara learn this? (Scene #)
2. [ ] Source: Direct experience or conversation?
3. [ ] Does this violate secrecy rule?

**For ALL characters:**
1. [ ] No references to future events (Scenes 9-15)
2. [ ] No knowledge of events they didn't experience
3. [ ] No anticipation of plot points they can't predict

### Common Traps to Avoid

❌ **Doogan mentioning Baxter's findings** (hasn't happened yet)  
❌ **Mara knowing about earpiece** (can never know)  
❌ **Winston referencing Doogan's "plan"** (doesn't know bigger picture)  
❌ **Jake mentioning investigation** (doesn't know about it)  
❌ **Any character mentioning Britney impression** (happens Scene 10)  

### Dramatic Irony Check

**Reader knows, Mara does NOT:**
- ✅ Doogan paid rebound specialist
- ✅ Jake hired him
- ✅ Investigation into murder/fraud
- ✅ Earpiece communication
- ✅ Team coordination

**This creates tension:** Mara catching feelings for Doogan while reader knows it's a job (complications ahead).
