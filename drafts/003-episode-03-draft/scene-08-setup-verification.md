## WHY (Scene Purpose)

### Narrative Function
1. **Investigation update** — Eddie/Abby report findings, pattern not making sense (dramatic irony)
2. **Job success visible** — Mara showing personality with media (Jake's goal achieved)
3. **Relationship escalation** — Mara actively pursues Doogan (turning point from professional to personal)
4. **Tension balance** — Doogan managing dual threads (murder investigation vs rebound job)

### Emotional Beats
- **Doogan:** Frustrated (investigation), pleased (Mara job working), conflicted (personal feelings emerging)
- **Mara:** Warm (with media), vulnerable (dinner invitation admission)
- **Jake:** Satisfied (seeing results of hiring rebound specialist)
- **Winston:** Uncomfortable (doesn't want spotlight)

### Story Arc Position
- **Job Arc:** Mara transformation working (cold → warm)
- **Investigation Arc:** Pattern emerging but confusing
- **Relationship Arc:** Shift from professional to personal (Mara catching feelings)
- **Episode Arc:** Midpoint turn (investigation intensifies, personal stakes rise)

---

## HOW (Logistics & Mechanisms)

### Earpiece Communication
**How it works:**
- Doogan wears covert CIA-level earpiece (established Scene 1, Baxter character file)
- Nearly invisible, bone conduction technology
- Baxter relays Eddie/Abby calls to Doogan
- Doogan walks away from crowd = privacy for updates
- Finger to earpiece = small gesture, not obvious to observers
- Must appear like Doogan making casual phone call (not suspicious)

**Why it's plausible:**
- Doogan away from media = giving Mara/Brenda spotlight (polite, not strange)
- Tournament just ended = phone calls normal (checking messages, calling friends)
- Covert device invisible at distance = no one notices earpiece

### Investigation Updates Delivery
**Eddie's update mechanism:**
- Eddie interviewed suburban wife Tuesday afternoon/evening (Scene 6)
- Calls in report to Baxter → Baxter relays to Doogan
- Content: Woman healthy, owns 5 dealerships, confused about over-prescription
- Pattern: Healthy patient over-prescribed (matches investigation theory)

**Abby's update mechanism:**
- Abby interviewed deceased woman's family + dying man Tuesday (Scene 6)
- Calls in report to Baxter → Baxter relays to Doogan
- Content: Deceased woman + dying man both have minimal records
- Pattern: Dying patients under-recorded (opposite of healthy patients)

**Why updates happen now:**
- Eddie/Abby conducted interviews Tuesday (Scene 6)
- Team meeting needed to share findings
- Doogan at tournament = earpiece updates instead of in-person briefing
- Timing plausible: 24 hours after interviews, team processing results

### Dinner Invitation Setup
**How Mara knows about dinner:**
- Brenda made reservation during/after tournament (off-screen)
- Mara/Brenda discussed plans while with media
- Winston mentioned needing to get home to wife (off-screen conversation)
- Mara pieced together: Winston leaving, Brenda has table, opportunity to invite Doogan

**Why Mara invites Doogan:**
- Warming to him over past 3 days (Scenes 3, 5, 7)
- Impressed by strategic thinking (Winston move)
- Enjoyed conversations and Tin Cup callbacks
- Feeling comfortable showing personal interest (job working)

**Why this is turning point:**
- Previous interactions: Professional, job-focused
- This invitation: Personal, pursuing time alone
- Mara vulnerable: Admits hoping he'd come (not casual)
- Doogan must recognize: Shift from job to personal relationship
