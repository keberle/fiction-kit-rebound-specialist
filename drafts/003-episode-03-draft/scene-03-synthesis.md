=== SCENE SYNTHESIS ===
Scene: Episode 3, Scene 3 — Welcome Gala & Auction

**FROM OUTLINE (beats to include):**
- Monday evening gala, black-tie event, charity auction in progress
- Doogan positioned in back of ballroom, watching
- Jake near bar, observing
- Auction lot announced: caddy for Mara Palani for entire Pro-Am
- Bidding starts at $500, competitive bidding happens
- Doogan wins at $3,000
- Tournament coordinator introduces Doogan to Mara
- Mara evaluates Doogan (have you caddied before?)
- Doogan's "Tin Cup" reference, Mara cracks first smile
- Coordinator announces Mara paired with Brenda Atwood and Marcus
- Mara's subtle reaction to amateur pairing
- Candy/Tilly entrance: photographers swarm, everything is content
- Press moment: Mara defensive with reporter Dave Chen
- Jake intervenes, Mara's "Phil Mickelson never had C-section" comment OR similar defensive reaction
- Doogan offers gentle redirect about phrasing
- Jake visibly cringing at sponsors' reactions
- Brenda characterized: warm, self-deprecating comedian
- Marcus: over-dramatic assistant, comic relief (mentioned but not overplayed)
- Turn: Teams set, Mara is wound tight, Doogan has met her
- Button: Jake watches nervously, 8 AM reminder

**FROM USER FEEDBACK (constraints/guidance):**
- "Keep it brief, action filled"
- "Don't overplay Mara" - this is first introduction, don't dig into character bio details
- "Women don't always bring their kids up to random people at charity auction" - no Alex mentions
- "Keep Jake as mostly a spectator" - he facilitates but doesn't dominate
- "Keep it entertaining, light and fresh, like Gregory McDonald would in Fletch novels"
- Do internet research on these types of scenes from Fletch books
- McDonald style: snappy dialogue, minimal description, wit through action, start mid-scene

**SYNTHESIS PLAN:**

1. **Opening:** Start mid-auction (McDonald rule), auctioneer already announcing lot. No atmospheric setup.

2. **Auction sequence:** Brief, rapid-fire bidding. Doogan wins at $3,000 (factcheck: Scene 1 established "three or four thousand" - $3K is low end, acceptable).

3. **Jake's reaction:** Since $3K is within expected range, Jake should acknowledge it as "right on target" not "more than expected."

4. **Mara introduction:** 
   - Keep reserved, professional, evaluative
   - Short, practical questions about caddying/golf experience
   - NO personal details about Alex, no emotional vulnerability yet
   - ONE almost-smile moment (earned, not overdone)
   - No "Phil Mickelson" line (user said don't overplay, save for different context)

5. **Press moment:**
   - Keep reporter encounter brief
   - Mara defensive but not overly emotional
   - Doogan's redirect subtle, not preachy
   - Jake's cringe reaction minimal (he's spectator)

6. **Brenda/Marcus/Candy:**
   - Mention them to set up teams
   - Don't give them big scenes
   - Candy entrance described, not dramatized
   - Marcus one line maximum

7. **Pacing:** Fast, dialogue-heavy, Gregory McDonald rhythm. Target 1,200-1,400 words maximum.

8. **Jake role:** Facilitates introduction, makes one comment about Mara's needs, mostly watches. He's broker, not participant.

**POTENTIAL CONFLICTS:**
- Outline wants "Phil Mickelson" defensive moment, user wants Mara not overplayed
- **Resolution:** Save that line for a later scene. Show Mara defensive with reporter but keep it briefer, less inflammatory.

- Outline wants Mara to crack smile at "Tin Cup" reference, but that might be overplaying warmth
- **Resolution:** "Almost smiled. Almost." - acknowledge the moment without making it a breakthrough.

- Outline includes detailed Brenda/Marcus characterization
- **Resolution:** Mention them, show voice briefly, but don't give them extended dialogue. Keep focus on Doogan/Mara meet.

**CORE SCENE PURPOSE (MUST PRESERVE):**
1. Establish Doogan's cover story (auction winner)
2. First meeting between Doogan and Mara (she's guarded, he's undaunted)
3. Set up tournament teams and dynamics
4. Show Mara wound tight, needs this week

**FLEXIBILITY IN EXECUTION:**
- Can adjust tone/depth of Mara's defensiveness
- Can minimize Jake's role beyond facilitator
- Can keep Brenda/Marcus/Candy mentions brief
- Can skip "Phil Mickelson" line entirely
- Can keep everything moving fast per McDonald style

**FACT REFERENCE TABLE:**

Reference #1: Jake's reaction to $3,000 bid
- Will appear as: Jake comments on auction amount after Doogan wins
- Source: Scene 1, lines 102-103
- Established detail: Jake said "Whatever it takes. Three or four thousand should do it."
- Constraint: Jake CANNOT say it exceeded expectations. $3,000 is low end of range. Appropriate responses: "Right on target", "Three thousand. That works", or don't comment on amount at all.

Reference #2: Doogan's golf game
- Will appear as: Mara asks when he last played, how he shot
- Source: Scene 1, entire scene (14th hole at Willow Creek)
- Established detail: They played Sunday afternoon at Willow Creek Country Club
- Constraint: Doogan says "this afternoon" (Scene 3 is Monday evening, so Sunday = day before = "yesterday" or "this afternoon" works if gala is Monday late afternoon/early evening)

Reference #3: Jenny's absence
- Will appear as: Jake mentions Mara's regular caddy
- Source: Scene 1, lines 90-93
- Established detail: Jake said "I gave Jenny the week off. Paid her full rate anyway."
- Constraint: Keep consistent - Jenny visiting family, Jake arranged it, Doogan as substitute makes sense.

**TIMELINE CHECK:**
- Scene 1: Sunday afternoon (14th hole golf meeting)
- Scene 2: Sunday evening/Monday morning (Abby at clinic)
- Scene 3: Monday evening (gala)
- Time reference: "this afternoon" for golf round = acceptable if gala is Monday evening (24 hours ago is still "recently")
