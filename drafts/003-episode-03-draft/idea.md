# Draft Idea (Intent Spec)

**Draft:** 003-episode-03-draft
**Created:** 2025-12-29

## Intent Summary
Draft Episode 3 ("The Professional Golfer") from the existing outline. This episode introduces Mara Palani's rebound job during a week-long Celebrity Pro-Am tournament, where Doogan serves as her substitute caddy. The episode interweaves three narrative threads: the A-plot (Mara's tournament and growing chemistry with Doogan), the B-plot (Eddie and Abby's patient investigation revealing a pattern connected to Nurse Nancy), and the Martinez subplot (Martinez confronting Doogan and returning the earpiece). Episode ends with Abby realizing Doogan is the perfect person to investigate Nancy.

## Motivation
- Establishes the series rhythm: Doogan takes "normal" rebound jobs while the clinic investigation deepens
- Provides relief and contrast after Episode 2's intensity (wedding weekend, clinic infiltration)
- Introduces Mara Palani, a significant character with her own compelling arc
- Advances the clinic conspiracy through patient interviews and Nancy identification
- Escalates Martinez's awareness of Doogan's operation
- Creates natural setup for Episode 4 (Doogan investigating Nancy)

## Scope
- **Affected outline/scenes/files:** 
  - `elements/outlines/episode-03.md` (source material)
  - `content/episodes/episode-03-the-professional-golfer/` (to be created)
  - 14 scenes spanning Sunday–Friday of tournament week
- **Characters involved:** 
  - Doogan Andrews (POV anchor)
  - Mara Palani (rebound client, professional golfer)
  - Jake Townsend (Mara's agent, job broker)
  - Eddie Palmer (Doogan's handler)
  - Abby Palmer (investigation lead)
  - Nurse Nancy (antagonist introduction)
  - Brenda Atwood (comedian, Mara's Pro-Am partner)
  - Marcus (Brenda's assistant)
  - Candy Hoover (rival golfer)
  - Paul Martinez (detective, escalating pressure)
  - Rodney Baxter (tech support, data analysis)
- **Settings involved:** 
  - Willow Creek Country Club (Pacific Point) — Sunday briefing
  - Strip Mall Clinic (Pacific Point) — Abby's infiltration attempt
  - Hidden Hills Golf Club (Rancho Palos Verdes) — tournament venue
  - Hidden Hills Resort — welcome gala
  - Nail salon — Abby's undercover work

## Desired Outcome
- Complete 14-scene episode following outline structure
- Establish Mara as compelling character with authentic golf world detail
- Advance clinic investigation to Nancy identification
- Show Martinez closing in on Doogan's operation
- Create strong episode-ending hook for Episode 4
- Balance tournament action with investigation subplot
- Maintain Doogan's POV throughout without head-hopping
- Deliver satisfying standalone episode while advancing serial arc

## Constraints / Non‑Negotiables
- Must follow established timeline (Episode 2 ended Thursday night; Episode 3 begins Sunday)
- Doogan POV only — no access to Abby/Eddie scenes except through phone calls, reports, or in-person meetings
- Tournament details must be accurate to professional golf
- Mara's characterization must match her established profile (reserved, technical, fierce competitor, protective single mom)
- Nancy introduction must be subtle — not revealed as antagonist yet
- Martinez subplot must escalate tension without derailing main narrative
- Episode must work as standalone while serving serial arc

## Serial Beat Requirements
- **Hook:** Sunday afternoon golf meeting — Jake pitches Mara job; Doogan accepts readily, needs distraction from Episode 2 events
- **Escalation/Turn:** Multiple escalations: (1) Martinez returns earpiece Thursday, reveals deeper investigation; (2) Patient pattern emerges — Nancy connection identified; (3) Mara opens up about son Alex, shows vulnerability
- **End‑Button / Cliffhanger:** Friday evening after nail salon — Abby to Eddie: "I know exactly who can get close to Nancy. And he's going to hate this." (Sets up Episode 4)

## Success Checks (Acceptance Criteria)
- [ ] All 14 scenes from outline drafted with proper hooks/turns/buttons
- [ ] Doogan POV maintained throughout without head-hopping
- [ ] Mara characterized consistently (reserved → warming → vulnerable progression)
- [ ] Golf tournament details feel authentic and specific
- [ ] Investigation subplot advances clearly through Doogan-accessible beats
- [ ] Martinez subplot escalates tension appropriately
- [ ] Episode ending creates strong momentum into Episode 4
- [ ] Dialogue matches established voice patterns for all characters
- [ ] Timeline continuity maintained from Episode 2
- [ ] No invented details contradict elements files

## Open Questions
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should any scenes require expanded detail beyond outline, or follow outline beats precisely?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Preferred balance between tournament action vs investigation subplot in Doogan's perspective?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Level of golf technical detail — authentic but accessible, or assume reader knowledge?]

## Assumptions
- Following outline scene structure exactly (14 scenes, Sunday through Friday)
- Doogan learns about investigation progress through group calls/check-ins with Eddie and Abby
- Tournament atmosphere and Mara's golf performance are central to episode experience
- Nancy's introduction should feel incidental, not sinister (reader doesn't know she's important yet)
- Martinez confrontation is brief but menacing, setting up ongoing threat
