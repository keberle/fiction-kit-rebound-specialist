## Serial Episode Beats

### Episode 3: "The Professional Golfer"

**Hook (Scene 1):**
- Opens mid-conversation on golf course tee box
- Eddie pitching job to Jake while playing golf
- Doogan picks up on subtext: this is about more than personality
- Jake reveals real problem: Mara can't get endorsements despite being three-time major champion
- Doogan accepts readily — needs distraction after Episode 2 intensity
- **Hook success criteria:** Reader immediately engaged by job pitch; stakes clear; Doogan's motivation (needs normalcy) established

**Escalation Points:**
- **Scene 5 (Tuesday):** Mara's skills competition day; chemistry with Doogan develops
- **Scene 7 (Wednesday morning):** Winston introduced; Doogan's strategic thinking impresses Mara
- **Scene 8 (Wednesday afternoon):** Post-tournament (off-screen Best Ball); investigation updates; Mara invites Doogan to dinner
- **Scene 9 (Wednesday evening):** Baxter discovers palliative care equipment in Nancy's exam room
- **Scene 10 (Thursday):** Fourth hole incident creates Candy/Mara rivalry
- **Scene 11 (Thursday):** Martinez confronts Doogan, returns earpiece, reveals deeper investigation
- **Scene 12 (Thursday evening):** Mara's vulnerability about Alex; woman watching them (has mug shot)
- **Scene 13 (Thursday night):** Nancy identified as connecting thread; nail salon plan formed
- **Scene 14 (Friday):** Tournament climax — Mara wins through trust in Doogan's advice

**End-Button / Cliffhanger (Scene 14):**
- Abby reports Nancy living beyond her means
- Baxter confirms financials don't add up
- Abby delivers final line to Eddie: "I know exactly who can get close to Nancy. And he's going to hate this."
- **Cliffhanger success criteria:** Reader knows Doogan will investigate Nancy next; tension between successful Mara job and dangerous new assignment; forward momentum into Episode 4

### Individual Scene Buttons
Each scene must end with forward momentum (not resolution):
- Scene 1: Eddie jokes about being jealous of golf resort job
- Scene 2: Abby commits to visiting patients directly
- Scene 3: Jake watches nervously as Doogan meets Mara
- Scene 4: Eddie and Abby divide patient list
- Scene 5: Professional partnership established with Mara
- Scene 6: Pattern emerges (healthy over-prescribed, dying under-recorded)
- Scene 7: Jake tells Eddie it's working better than expected
- Scene 8: Martinez returns earpiece, "question mark" speech, Radio Shack callback
- Scene 9: Sponsors already calling Jake
- Scene 10: Fourth hole incident - rivalry escalates
- Scene 11: Candy's glare from across the green - tomorrow is war
- Scene 12: Baxter reveals woman watching them has mug shot
- Scene 13: Abby commits to undercover nail salon visit
- Scene 14: Mara wins, shows personality, sponsors calling
- Scene 15: Abby's final line about Doogan investigating Nancy

## Sequence of Work

### Phase 1: Context Loading & Verification (Pre-Writing)
1. Read all character files for characters appearing in Episode 3
2. Verify timeline continuity from Episode 2 ending
3. Review Episode 1 & 2 scenes for voice consistency patterns
4. Confirm tournament structure details (formats, schedule)
5. Verify checklist constraints (secrecy rule, character voices, POV rules)

### Phase 2: Scene Drafting (Sequential)
Draft scenes in story order (1-15) to maintain continuity:

**Sunday Block (Scenes 1-2):**
- Scene 1: Golf course meeting
- Scene 2: Abby's clinic visit (reported to Doogan)

**Monday Block (Scenes 3-4):**
- Scene 3: Charity gala and auction
- Scene 4: Patient list briefing at Eddie's house

**Tuesday Block (Scenes 5-6):**
- Scene 5: Golf Fun Day with Mara
- Scene 6: Eddie/Abby patient visit reports (group call)

**Wednesday Block (Scenes 7-8):**

- Scene 15: Nail salon results and Episode 4 setup

### Phase 3: Continuity Pass
1. Verify POV never head-hops
2. Check character voice consistency across all scenes
3. Confirm no scene opens with information reader just learned (McDonald Rule)
4. Verify investigation beats are accessible to Doogan through calls/reports
5. Check tournament details remain consistent
6. Verify episode length target (12K-15K words)

### Phase 4: Polish Pass
1. Ensure each scene has clear hook/turn/button
2. Verify dialogue dominates (80-90% per McDonald style)
3. Remove any authorial commentary
4. Check for minimal scene openings (dialogue or action, never atmosphere)
5. Verify humor is earned, not forced
6. Confirm stakes remain serious despite comedy moments

## POV Distribution & Off-Screen Information

### POV Anchor: Doogan Andrews (All 15 Scenes)

**Doogan Present (Direct Experience):**
- Scenes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 — Doogan physically present for events

**Doogan Receives Information (Indirect Delivery):**
- Scene 2: Learns about Abby's clinic visit via phone call/check-in
- Scene 4: Present at Eddie's house while Baxter briefs team on patient data
- Scene 6: Group call while he's between tournament activities — Eddie/Abby report patient visit findings
- Scene 8: Referenced but condensed — pattern already established
- Scene 13: Group video call — team identifies Nancy connection, plans nail salon visit
- Scene 15: Abby calls/reports nail salon findings to Doogan (and Eddie/Baxter)

**Fair-Play Mechanism:**
All investigation beats reach Doogan through:
- Phone calls with Eddie/Abby (dialogue recounting)
- Group video calls visible in scenes
- In-person briefings at Eddie's house
- Text messages with updates

**Never:**
- Dramatizing scenes where Doogan isn't present
- Head-hopping to Abby's patient visits
- Showing Eddie's encounters directly
- Revealing Nancy's internal thoughts or motivations

## Open Questions

1. **Golf Technical Detail Balance:** How much golf terminology and course strategy should be explained vs. assumed reader knowledge? Options:
   - **Minimal explanation:** Assume readers understand basics (par, birdie, formats)
   - **Contextual explanation:** Explain through Doogan asking questions or characters discussing
   - **Preference:** Contextual explanation through Doogan learning caddy role

2. **Investigation Scene Length:** Should patient investigation beats be full scenes or briefer report-style beats within larger scenes? Options:
   - **Full scenes:** 800-1,000 words each with complete dramatic structure
   - **Compressed beats:** 400-600 words focusing on findings delivery
   - **Preference:** Compressed beats delivered through dialogue (more efficient, maintains momentum)

3. **Mara/Doogan Romance Pacing:** How explicit should the growing attraction be, given Doogan's professional boundaries? Options:
   - **Subtle tension:** Implication only, professional throughout
   - **Acknowledged attraction:** Both aware but Doogan maintains boundaries
   - **Preference:** Acknowledged attraction (Doogan's internal conflict adds tension)

4. **Nancy Introduction Subtlety:** How much should Nancy's antagonist role be telegraphed vs. hidden? Options:
   - **Completely neutral:** Just another nurse until Scene 12 reveal
   - **Slightly off:** Reader senses something but can't pinpoint it
   - **Preference:** Slightly off — Abby notes "bitchy" behavior but doesn't flag as sinister

5. **Martinez Threat Level:** Should Martinez feel like an immediate danger or a simmering background threat? Options:
   - **Immediate:** Suggests arrest could happen soon
   - **Simmering:** Building a case, watching, but patient
   - **Preference:** Simmering — returns earpiece but makes clear he's digging deeper

---

## Assumptions

1. **Tournament Authenticity:** Assume professional golf tournament details (formats, protocols, media) must be accurate. Will reference real LPGA tournament structures for Best Ball, Modified Scramble, and Exhibition formats.

2. **Scene 2 Structure:** Assume Abby's clinic visit (Scene 2) is told TO Doogan via phone rather than dramatized directly, maintaining POV constraints. Doogan learns about it same time reader does.

3. **Character File Details:** Assume all details in `mara-palani.md` are canonical — her background, Alex's age, her parents' roles, her vehicle choice, etc. Will not invent contradictory details.

4. **Eddie's Bunions Story:** Assume Eddie's patient visit comedy (bunion sanding) is delivered through dialogue in Scene 6 group call, not dramatized as full scene. Comic relief through Eddie's exasperated recounting.

5. **Weather Gambit Mechanism:** Assume Baxter's weather analysis (high-pressure system affecting ball carry) is scientifically plausible and will be explained through Doogan's earpiece dialogue with Baxter during Scene 13.

6. **Nancy Nail Detail:** Assume Abby's casual mention of Nancy's "nice nails" in Scene 2 plants detail that pays off in Scene 12 when Eddie recalls the nail salon. This is intentional Chekhov's gun.

7. **Jake's Agent Role:** Assume Jake Townsend operates as both Mara's agent AND job broker for Eddie's team. His dual role creates natural cover for Doogan's presence but also pressure for results.

8. **Hidden Hills Location:** Assume Hidden Hills Golf Club is fictional venue in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA (real city). Allows creative freedom while maintaining Southern California accuracy.

9. **Alex Appearances:** Assume Alex appears only via video call in Scene 5. He's not present at tournament. All other references to him come through Mara's dialogue about missing him.

10. **Episode 4 Setup:** Assume Episode 4 will involve Doogan investigating Nancy directly (as Abby suggests in Scene 14 ending). This episode exists to set up that premise while delivering standalone Mara arc.

11. **Timeline Spacing:** Assume "Sunday" beginning of Episode 3 is approximately 3-4 days after Episode 2's Thursday night ending. Enough time for things to cool down but not so much that urgency is lost.

12. **Secrecy Rule Compliance:** Assume Mara NEVER learns Doogan is paid. She believes Jake assigned him as substitute caddy via the charity auction mechanism. Cover story holds throughout episode.

13. **Word Count Flexibility:** Assume 12K-15K target is flexible. If episode naturally runs 14K-16K due to tournament scenes requiring atmosphere, that's acceptable. Priority is story quality over strict word count.

14. **Voice Consistency:** Assume Episodes 1-2 establish baseline for character voices (Eddie's motor-mouth, Doogan's short responses, Abby's elevated style). Will match those patterns exactly.
