## Beat Mechanism Verification

### Tournament OFF-SCREEN
**Question:** How did tournament conclude off-screen?  
**Answer:** Standard Best Ball format (established Scene 1). Mara/Doogan vs Brenda/Winston pairs. Results not critical to story—focus on aftermath, not golf action.  
**Verified:** ✅ Scene 1 established Pro-Am format, Scene 8 outline specifies OFF-SCREEN

### Brenda Playing Well
**Question:** How does Brenda's improvement work?  
**Answer:** "Effortless" cue from Scene 5 + Winston's conservative caddy strategy (Scene 7) = competent play. Best Ball format forgiving (Mara's skill carried team).  
**Verified:** ✅ Scene 5 established cue, Scene 7 established Winston strategy

### Marcus Content
**Question:** How does Marcus have extensive footage?  
**Answer:** Scene 7 relieved from caddy duties (clubs too heavy), freed to film with phone. Filmed Brenda's shots, Mara's play, behind-scenes moments.  
**Verified:** ✅ Scene 7 established Marcus filming instead of caddying

### Earpiece Updates
**Question:** How does Doogan get updates during public event?  
**Answer:** Covert CIA-level earpiece (established Doogan/Baxter character files). Doogan walks away from crowd = privacy. Baxter relays Eddie/Abby reports. Small finger-to-ear gesture.  
**Verified:** ✅ Character files establish earpiece, Scene 1 establishes team communication

### Dinner Invitation
**Question:** How does Mara know about dinner?  
**Answer:** Brenda made reservation off-screen, Mara/Brenda discussed, Winston mentioned going home, Mara invited Doogan (all plausible off-screen conversations).  
**Verified:** ✅ Character dynamics support off-screen planning

**All beat mechanisms verified:** ✅
