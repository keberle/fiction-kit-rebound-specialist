=== SCENE SETUP VERIFICATION ===
Scene: Episode 3, Scene 3 — Welcome Gala & Auction

**OUTLINE SOURCE (elements/outlines/episode-03.md):**
> **Scene 3: The Welcome Gala & Charity Auction (Monday evening)**
> - WHO: Doogan (POV), Jake, Mara Palani, tournament coordinator, Brenda Atwood, Marcus Shaw, Candy Williams
> - WHERE: Hidden Hills Clubhouse ballroom, black-tie gala
> - WHAT: Charity auction in progress, caddy lot comes up
> - Doogan positioned in back, Jake near bar

> - Press approaches Mara, Doogan observes her handling questions
> - Jake gives Doogan thumbs-up from across room
> - BUTTON: "This was going to be interesting"

**USER GUIDANCE (from implement request):**
- "Keep it brief, action filled"
- "Don't overplay Mara... Keep Jake as mostly a spectator"
- "Keep it entertaining, light and fresh, like Gregory McDonald would in Fletch novels"

**SYNTHESIS RESOLUTION:**
- Brief = 1,200-1,400 words (vs. Scene 1's 1,500)
- Action-filled = continuous motion, quick exchanges, multiple micro-scenes
- Don't overplay Mara = polite but reserved, no Alex backstory, one almost-smile at best
- Jake as spectator = minimal dialogue, mostly observing, facilitates introduction but doesn't dominate
- McDonald style = 80-90% dialogue, minimal description, start mid-action

**SCENE STRUCTURE:**

**Hook:** Open on auction in progress (McDonald opening: start mid-scene)
- Auctioneer calling out caddy lot
- Doogan in back observing (per outline)
- Brief bidding war (entertainment value)
- Doogan wins at $3,000

**Turn:** Introduction and team announcement
- Tournament coordinator brings Doogan to Mara
- Brief, polite exchange (Mara reserved, Doogan enthusiastic fan cover)
- Teams announced over microphone
- Mara paired with Brenda/Marcus
- Doogan observes press questions (show Mara handling spotlight)

**Button:** Jake's thumbs-up, Doogan's observation
- "This was going to be interesting"

**POV ANCHOR:** Doogan Andrews (third-person close)
- Filter: Everything through Doogan's observations
- Tense: Past tense
- Voice: Southern drawl patterns, dry humor, "Doogan Pause", reluctant professionalism
- Knowledge limit: Knows Jake hired him, knows Mara's comeback story from Jake's pitch, does NOT know Alex situation, must act like casual golf fan

**CHARACTER VOICES TO MAINTAIN:**

Doogan:
- Polite Southern drawl
- Brief responses
- Dry observations
- "Doogan Pause" (beat before response)
- Reluctant but professional

Jake:
- Facilitator role (minimal dialogue this scene)
- Observing from distance
- One gesture: thumbs-up

Mara:
- Reserved, polite
- Professional responses
- No warmth yet (first meeting)
- Handles press smoothly

Brenda:
- Warm, self-deprecating humor
- Comedian energy

Tournament Coordinator:
- Professional, efficient
- Standard hosting duties

**SCENE NECESSITIES:**

MUST HAPPEN:

**FACT VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS:**

During writing, when I write:
1. Jake's reaction to $3K bid → verify against Scene 1 ("three or four thousand")
2. Any reference to Doogan's recent golf → verify against Scene 1 (Willow Creek, shot 79)
3. Any mention of Jenny (Mara's caddy) → verify against Scene 1 (visiting family)
4. Any Mara backstory details → verify against mara-palani.md
5. Any tournament procedure details → verify against elements/events/hidden-hills-celebrity-pro-am.md

RED FLAG PHRASES TO AVOID:
- "That was more than we discussed"
- "you said [X]" (forces reference to past scene)
- "I thought you meant [X]"
- "That's not what we agreed"
- Any comparative phrase about expectations

**FINAL CHECKLIST:**
