# Draft Folder Template (Fiction Kit)

This folder defines the standard per-draft artifact layout.

Each new draft cycle should create a folder under `drafts/###-short-name/` containing:

- `idea.md` — the intent/spec for the draft (WHAT/WHY)
- `clarify.md` — clarification Q&A log (tightens intent before planning)
- `plan.md` — structural blueprint (HOW at a high level)
- `tasks.md` — executable task breakdown (atomic, traceable)
- `analyze.md` — read-only analysis reports (coverage/consistency checks)
- `feedback.md` — editorial/agent/QA feedback captured for this draft

These mirror GitHub Spec Kit’s “feature folder” convention, adapted for fiction.
