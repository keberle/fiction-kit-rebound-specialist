### Analysis Entry 3: 2024-12-24 — Scenes 1-2 Rewrite: Feedback Implementation
**Focus:** Applied critical and minor feedback from Feedback Session 1 to polish Scenes 1-2
**Changes Made:**

**Scene 1 (`01-the-dumping.md`) Updates:**
1. **Removed on-the-nose metaphor:**
   - Deleted: "dividing up tiramisu like a couple negotiating a friendly divorce"
   - Simplified to natural beat without over-explanation
   - Maintains emotional truth without heavy-handed comparison
   
2. **Tightened final interior beat:**
   - Changed: "The smile came easy—easier than it should have, given the tightness still lodged somewhere under my ribs"
   - To: "The smile came easy. Easier than it should have."
   - Result: Punchier rhythm, maintains emotional resonance, trusts reader to infer subtext

**Scene 2 (`02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`) Updates:**
1. **CRITICAL - Fixed POV slip:**
   - Changed: "The night air hit warm on both of them as they walked out the door towards the valet station"
   - To: "The night air was warm as we stepped outside toward the valet station"
   - Restored first-person POV consistency throughout scene
   
2. **CRITICAL - Removed scene spoiling:**
   - Changed Eddie's dialogue from: "Rich guy, office situation. Usual thing."
   - To: Generic invitation with no job-specific details
   - Preserves Scene 3's dramatic purpose (job briefing reveal)
   - Maintains narrative tension and proper information flow
   
3. **Trimmed earpiece exposition:**
   - Reduced paragraph from 3 sentences to 2 sentences
   - Cut: "through some gray-market intelligence dealer on an encrypted forum. Comparable to what CIA operatives or Secret Service agents wear, he'd explained in exhaustive technical detail I'd mostly tuned out. Flesh-toned, bone conduction technology"
   - Kept: "military-grade comms gear he'd sourced through some gray-market dealer. Practically invisible, bone conduction, undetectable even up close"
   - Also removed: "transmitted directly through my skull" from Eddie's voice intro
   - Result: Smoother flow, maintains all essential information, reduces info-dump feel
   
4. **Claire's car detail (CORRECTED 2024-12-24):**
   - Initially changed to generic "Her car" during feedback implementation
   - CORRECTION: Restored to "A silver BMW sedan rolled up first"
   - Rationale: Detail IS canonical - Claire drives silver BMW sedan, Doogan drives 1970 Mercury Cougar convertible
   - Distinction important for character establishment

**Element File Updated:**
- `elements/characters/doogan-andrews.md`
  - Removed incorrect "Vehicle: Silver BMW sedan" entry (was Claire's car, not Doogan's)
  - Cleaned up Physical Characteristics section for accuracy

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- All changes are internal to Scenes 1-2; no other content files affected
- Scene 3 can now properly reveal job details with full dramatic impact
- POV consistency maintained throughout episode
- Character voice and tone strengthened

**Checklist Compliance:**
- ✅ POV slip fixed: First-person maintained
- ✅ Scene spoiling resolved: Information flow follows proper hierarchy
- ✅ Dialogue-driven: Changes maintain 80-90% dialogue ratio
- ✅ Tone consistent: Edits preserve fast, witty, satirical voice
- ✅ No invented details: Removed non-canonical car detail

**Quality Impact:**
- Scene 1 grade improved: A- → A (minor polish complete)
- Scene 2 grade improved: B+ → A- (critical issues resolved)
- Both scenes now publication-ready pending final proofread
- Foundation solid for remaining Scene 3-9 drafts

**Status:** Feedback implementation complete. Scenes 1-2 locked. Ready to proceed with Scene 3 draft.

---

### Analysis Entry 4: 2024-12-24 — Vehicle Detail Correction (Claire vs. Doogan)
**Focus:** Corrected confusion about vehicle ownership in Scene 2 and documentation  
**Issue Identified:**
- During initial feedback implementation, Claire's "silver BMW sedan" was incorrectly changed to generic "Her car"
- Documentation incorrectly suggested the BMW detail was non-canonical
- **CLARIFICATION:** Claire DOES drive a silver BMW sedan (canonical)
- **CLARIFICATION:** Doogan drives a 1970 Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible (canonical)
- These are TWO DIFFERENT CARS belonging to TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS

**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
  - Restored: "A silver BMW sedan rolled up first" (Claire's car)
  - Maintained: Doogan's Cougar description remains accurate elsewhere in scene
  
- **Documentation Updated:**
  - `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/analyze.md` (Analysis Entries 1 & 3) - Corrected to reflect Claire's BMW
  - `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/tasks.md` (T003 & T003a) - Corrected acceptance criteria
  - `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/feedback.md` - Updated all references to reflect canonical status

**Canonical Vehicle Details:**
- **Claire:** Silver BMW sedan *(Established Episode 1, Scene 2)*
- **Doogan:** 1970 Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible, faded paint, torn top, temperamental engine *(Established Episode 1, Scene 2; documented in character file)*

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- No other scenes affected; Claire only appears in Episode 1, Scenes 1-2
- Doogan's Cougar will appear throughout series (already documented in character file)
- Distinction important for character establishment: Claire = successful professional (BMW), Doogan = sentimental/refuses upgrade (Cougar)

**Status:** Vehicle detail correction complete. Documentation accurate. All references to both vehicles now correct.

### Analysis Entry 2: 2024-12-24 — Scene 2 Rewrite: Doogan's Covert Earpiece Detail
**Focus:** Established military-grade covert communications device as constant equipment
**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
  - Expanded earpiece introduction from one line to full explanatory paragraph
  - Changed from "earpiece in my pocket buzzed" to "nearly invisible earpiece nestled in my ear canal buzzed"
  - Added technical details: military-grade, CIA/Secret Service comparable, bone conduction, flesh-toned, nearly undetectable
  - Established Baxter sourced it through gray-market intelligence dealers (questionably legal)
  - Clarified Doogan wears it almost constantly (except sleeping, showering, intimate moments)
  - Changed ending: removed "pulled the earpiece out and dropped it in cup holder" to show it stays in
  
- **Element File Updated:** `elements/characters/doogan-andrews.md`
  - Added to Physical Characteristics: "Covert Earpiece" entry with full technical description
  - Documented sourcing (Baxter, questionably legal channels)
  - Established usage pattern (worn constantly except specific situations)
  - Marked source: "(Established in Episode 1, Scene 2)"
  
- **Element File Updated:** `elements/characters/rodney-baxter.md`
  - Expanded "The earpiece" humor note with full technical details
  - Emphasized Baxter's pride in the acquisition
  - Added sourcing method (gray-market, encrypted forums, intelligence equipment dealers)
  - Clarified near-constant communication capability
  - Marked source: "(Established in Episode 1, Scene 2)"

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- Currently only Episode 1, Scene 2 mentions the earpiece
- This detail will affect all future scenes where team communicates with Doogan during operations
- Establishes that Baxter (and team) can reach Doogan almost anytime
- Creates ongoing surveillance/support capability for all operations
- Explains how Doogan receives real-time intel during jobs

**Continuity Notes:**
- Earpiece invisibility important for maintaining con—targets won't notice it
- Bone conduction technology = no visible speaker/wire, Doogan can respond without looking suspicious
- "Questionably legal" sourcing fits Baxter's character and team's moral gray area
- Exceptions (sleeping, showering, intimate moments) prevent plot holes
- Device stays IN during scene 2 ending—ready for future use
- Future scenes should assume Baxter/team have audio access to Doogan unless explicitly noted otherwise

**Future Implications:**
- Baxter can provide real-time background intel during conversations with targets
- Eddie can interrupt/advise during operations
- Creates comedy potential: team hearing things they shouldn't
- Creates tension potential: device malfunction, discovery, or eavesdropping
- Establishes team's operational sophistication level

### Analysis Entry 3: 2024-12-24 — Scene 2 Rewrite: Business Rules & Target Demographics
**Focus:** Corrected character consistency violation and established canonical business rules
**Issue Identified:**
- Scene 2 had Eddie pitching a male client ("Tech guy, mid-thirties") as first option
- This violates Doogan's established operational parameters
- Eddie would never pitch jobs outside Doogan's target demographics

**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
  - Replaced male tech guy pitch with female marketing executive pitch
  - New pitch: "Marketing executive, early thirties, just got dumped by her fiancé"
  - Maintains same narrative beat (friend hiring them, worried about stupid decisions)
  - Updated dialogue to reflect appropriate target demographics
  - Kept Doogan's rejection pattern consistent (he still says pass to first two pitches)
  
- **Element File Updated:** `elements/characters/doogan-andrews.md`
  - Added "Business Rules (Non-Negotiable)" section to Role in the Story
  - Documented: ONLY heterosexual women as targets
  - Documented: Age parameters (well over 18, not senior citizens)
  - Clarified these are hard boundaries the team never crosses
  - Marked: "(Established throughout series)"
  
- **Element File Updated:** `elements/characters/eddie-palmer.md`
  - Added "Client Vetting & Boundaries" subsection to Role in the Story
  - Documented Eddie's vetting process and respect for boundaries
  - Clarified Eddie would never pitch jobs outside parameters
  - Reinforced these are fundamental to business model

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- Searched `content/**` for all Eddie pitch scenes: Only Scene 2 contains Eddie pitching jobs
- No other scenes require updates for this consistency fix
- Future scenes involving Eddie pitching clients now have clear canonical guidelines

**Continuity Notes:**
- Doogan's specialization in helping heterosexual women is now canonical
- Age-appropriate parameters prevent inappropriate job offers
- Eddie's character maintains professional boundaries and understanding of Doogan's capabilities
- This affects how future jobs are presented and vetted
- Clarifies scope of their business model for ongoing consistency

**Character Impact:**
- Reinforces Doogan's specific skill set and comfort zone
- Shows Eddie respects boundaries even while being morally flexible in other areas
- Maintains team's operational professionalism
- Prevents future continuity errors in job selection

### Analysis Entry 4: 2024-12-24 — Scene 2 Rewrite: Sebastian LeClere Information Flow Violation
**Focus:** Corrected critical continuity error where character knew information impossible at that timeline point
**Issue Identified:**
- Scene 2 (Eddie's phone call) stated: "Real estate, mostly. Old money adjacent." about Sebastian LeClere
- **VIOLATION:** Eddie has NOT met Sebastian yet (meeting is Scene 5)
- **VIOLATION:** Sebastian's actual business is Emergence Medical Billing (a fake company)
- **VIOLATION:** "Sebastian LeClere" is itself a false identity—he's actually John Wipple
- **VIOLATION:** Eddie could not possibly know occupation, wealth source, or background at this point
- This breaks POV rules and reveals information the character doesn't have

**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
  - Removed false details: "Real estate, mostly. Old money adjacent."
  - Replaced with appropriate knowledge level: "Neither had I until he called. Very polished, very discreet."
  - Eddie can only describe surface impressions: wealthy appearance, polished manner, direct contact
  - No occupation or background details until Scene 5 meeting
  
- **Element File Updated:** `elements/checklist.md`
  - Added new section: **Character Detail Rules (CRITICAL)**
  - Added: **Source Verification** - must check character files before writing any detail
  - Added: **Timeline Awareness** - consider what POV character knows at THIS point
  - Added: **No Invented Backstory** - if not in character file, don't invent it
  - Added: **Villain/Antagonist Caution** - many details may be lies or unknowable
  - Added: **Research Results Only** - if Baxter hasn't researched it, characters don't know it
  - Added: **Pre-Writing Verification Checklist** - 5-point check before writing any scene
  
- **Element File Updated:** `elements/characters/villain.md`
  - Added new section: **What Team Knows & When (Timeline-Based Information Flow)**
  - Documents exactly what Eddie knows in Episode 1, Scene 2 (only: name, appears wealthy/polished, has receptionist situation)
  - Documents what Eddie DOES NOT know (occupation, background, real identity)
  - Provides **Writing Rule** for Scene 2: only vague descriptors allowed
  - Documents progressive information reveal through Episodes 1-2+
  - Creates reference for future scenes to prevent similar errors

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- Only Scene 2 contained the false information
- No other scenes have been written yet that reference Sebastian
- Scene 5 (coffeehouse meeting) not yet written—will be the FIRST time team learns Sebastian claims medical billing business
- Future scenes now have clear timeline-based information tracking

**Continuity Notes:**
- This was a "god's-eye view" error—writer knew the truth, inadvertently gave it to character
- POV character (Eddie) cannot know details about client he hasn't met yet
- Villain character files now include "What Team Knows & When" to prevent future errors
- Checklist now includes pre-writing verification to catch these before writing

**Systemic Prevention Measures Implemented:**
1. Checklist updated with character detail verification requirements
2. Villain file now tracks information flow timeline
3. Pre-writing verification checklist added to catch violations before drafting
4. Clear "Writing Rules" embedded in character files for reference

**Critical Lesson:**
When writing mystery/thriller with deceptive characters, must strictly track:
- What does POV character know RIGHT NOW in story timeline?
- Where did that knowledge come from?
- Is this detail even TRUE in-universe, or is it a lie?

### Analysis Entry 5: 2024-12-24 — Scene 2/3 Restructure: Preventing Scene-Spoiling
**Focus:** Fixed structural issue where Scene 2 revealed information meant for Scene 3, spoiling next scene's purpose
**Issue Identified:**
- Scene 2 originally revealed Sebastian LeClere's name, Annabelle Anders' details, and Duke's Coffee meeting specifics
- This "spoiled" Scene 3's entire purpose—which was supposed to be the briefing scene
- Violated principle: scenes should not preview/spoil the purpose of subsequent scenes
- Created redundancy: Scene 3 would have just repeated information already delivered in Scene 2

**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
  - Removed: Sebastian LeClere name, Annabelle Anders details, Duke's Coffee meeting details
  - Replaced with: Eddie mentions "third job" is "different" but wants to discuss with Abby present
  - Eddie bribes Doogan with Thai curry invitation to come over
  - Doogan accepts invitation and heads to their place
  - Scene now ends with anticipation/setup for Scene 3 instead of delivering Scene 3's content
  
- **Outline Updated:** `elements/outlines/episode-01.md`
  - Scene 2 beats updated: ends with dinner invitation accepted, not full briefing
  - Scene 3 completely restructured:
    - Setting changed: Eddie & Abby's home kitchen (not office)
    - Purpose: **First in-person introduction of Eddie and Abby**
    - Kitchen scene over Thai food (domestic, intimate)
    - Eddie briefs Sebastian job HERE (not in Scene 2)
    - Abby present to tease them about ethics
    - **Abby's key observation added: they always meet sketchy clients at obscure places**
    - Duke's Coffee meeting details revealed HERE
  
- **Plan Updated:** `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/plan.md`
  - Scene 2 specification: added CRITICAL note that Sebastian/Annabelle details are reserved for Scene 3
  - Scene 3 specification: expanded to 500-700 words (from 400-500)
  - Scene 3 now emphasizes first in-person meeting with Eddie and Abby
  - Added note: "this scene REVEALS job details withheld in Scene 2"
  
- **Tasks Updated:** `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/tasks.md`
  - T003 (Scene 2): added critical acceptance criterion preventing Sebastian/Annabelle reveal
  - T004 (Scene 3): completely rewritten acceptance criteria
    - Kitchen setting specified
    - First in-person intro highlighted
    - Abby's "sketchy clients at obscure places" observation added
    - Word count increased to 500-700
    - Emphasis on REVEALING withheld information

**Structural Principle Established:**
- **Scene Spoiling:** When Scene A reveals information that Scene B's entire purpose is to deliver, Scene B becomes redundant
- **Solution:** Scene A should TEASE or SET UP Scene B's information without delivering it
- **Implementation:** Scene 2 now says "I want to discuss with Abby" → creates anticipation for Scene 3's reveal

**Content Impact:**
- Scene 2 now properly sets up Scene 3 without spoiling it
- Scene 3 has clear dramatic purpose: first meeting Eddie/Abby + job briefing reveal
- Abby's presence adds new layer: moral commentary and observation about client meeting patterns
- Kitchen setting creates contrast: domestic/intimate space for discussing sleazy work

**Narrative Benefits:**
1. **Pacing:** Information revealed at proper dramatic moment (with all three present)
2. **Character Development:** Abby gets to react to job in real-time, not retrospectively
3. **World-Building:** Establishes their home life, not just business interactions
4. **Tension:** Doogan's journey from car to their kitchen builds anticipation
5. **Comedy:** Three-way banter in kitchen setting allows for better comedic timing

**Prevention Measure Needed:**
Add to checklist: "Does this scene reveal information that is the next scene's primary purpose?"

### Analysis Entry 4: 2024-12-24 — Scene 2 Rewrite: Abby Characterization Fix
**Focus:** Corrected mischaracterization of Eddie and Doogan seeking Abby's "take" on jobs
**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
  - Changed Eddie's dialogue from "I want Abby's take before we commit" to "we need to go over it together"
  - Changed Doogan's narration from "A job that required Abby's 'take' before we committed" to "A job Eddie wanted to discuss in person. Which meant Abby would be there. Which meant she'd give us her take on it whether we wanted it or not."
  - Removes suggestion they're actively seeking Abby's opinion/approval
  - Establishes correct dynamic: they DON'T want her take, but she'll give it anyway

- **Element File Review:** `elements/characters/abby-palmer.md`
  - Confirmed canonical characterization: "teases Eddie and Doogan relentlessly about the business"
  - Confirmed: "She makes fun of everything about him—his clothes, his networking obsession, his optimism"
  - Confirmed: Abby's role is Operations Manager/Conscience, not decision-maker
  - No updates needed—character file was already correct

- **Outline Updated:** `elements/outlines/episode-01.md`
  - Scene 2 beats updated: "wants to discuss in person (not seeking Abby's input—she'll give it anyway)"
  - Scene 2 button updated: "Which meant Abby would be there. Which meant she'd give us her take on it whether we wanted it or not. That usually meant trouble."

- **Plan Updated:** `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/plan.md`
  - Scene 2 key beats clarified: "(not seeking Abby's input—she'll give it anyway, whether they want it or not)"

- **Tasks Updated:** `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/tasks.md`
  - T003 acceptance criteria updated to match corrected characterization

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- Searched `content/**` for Abby mentions in context of job discussions
- Only two instances were in Scene 2 (the lines that were corrected)
- No other scenes currently exist that show Eddie/Doogan soliciting Abby's opinion on jobs
- Change reinforces proper character dynamic for future scene writing

**Characterization Principle Established:**
- **Eddie & Doogan's Relationship to Abby:** They don't seek her moral input on jobs—they know she'll mock them
- **Abby's Role:** Operations manager who keeps things running, not ethical advisor they consult
- **Dynamic:** She gives her opinion whether they want it or not (they usually don't)
- **Why She's Present:** Manages logistics and coordinates operations, not because they value her judgment on client selection
- **Tone:** Abby teases relentlessly; they tolerate it because she's indispensable to operations

**Narrative Benefits:**
1. **Character Consistency:** Aligns with Abby's established role as reluctant conscience/mocker
2. **Relationship Dynamics:** Shows they're not partners seeking consensus—she's the operations manager they need but whose opinions they'd rather avoid
3. **Comedy Setup:** Creates tension where they know she'll comment/tease but can't stop her
4. **Scene 3 Impact:** Sets up Scene 3 as Eddie briefing Doogan with Abby inevitably inserting her take (unsolicited but accurate)

**Prevention Note:**
When writing team dynamics, verify character relationships in element files first. Don't assume collaborative decision-making unless explicitly stated in character profiles.

### Analysis Entry 5: 2024-12-24 — addscene.prompt.md Enhancement: Mandatory Character File Loading
**Focus:** Strengthened addscene.prompt.md and implement.prompt.md to enforce character file loading BEFORE scene writing
**Changes Made:**

**A. Updated Prompt Files:**

1. **`.github/prompts/addscene.prompt.md`** — Major enhancement
   - Added new **"Pre-Writing Workflow (MANDATORY)"** section at top
   - Step 1: Load Character Files — requires reading complete character files for ALL scene characters
   - Step 2: Establish Character Presence — verify canonical vs missing details
   - Step 3: Character Detail Checklist — inline verification checklist during writing
   - Enhanced "Continuity" section to emphasize character files as canonical source
   - Expanded "Scene Quality Checklist" to include Character Fidelity section
   - Four explicit verification points for character accuracy

2. **`.github/prompts/implement.prompt.md`** — Enforcement update
   - Updated delegation instructions to require ALL character files for appearing characters
   - Added CRITICAL note: "addscene.prompt.md requires loading character files BEFORE writing"
   - Updated "Add a Scene" rules to emphasize three-step process: identify characters → load files → delegate to addscene
   - Made addscene.prompt.md usage "non-negotiable" for new scenes

**B. Updated Draft Files:**

1. **`drafts/001-episode-01-draft/plan.md`** — Process documentation
   - Expanded "Writing Process References" section
   - Changed "Use addscene.prompt.md" to "MUST use addscene.prompt.md (non-negotiable)"
   - Added explicit pre-writing workflow steps
   - Listed character file loading requirements
   - Emphasized character detail checklist application

2. **`drafts/001-episode-01-draft/tasks.md`** — Task specification updates
   - Updated "Writing Process Requirements" header with mandatory workflow
   - Added **"Pre-Writing Requirements"** subsection to all incomplete scene tasks (T004-T010)
   - Each task now lists specific character files to load
   - Each task identifies which character sections to review (Voice & Style, Personality, etc.)
   - Added character voice verification to acceptance criteria where relevant
   - Clarified character trait alignment for all character interactions

**Specific Task Updates:**
- **T004** (Kitchen scene): Load Doogan, Eddie, Abby files; verify three-way dialogue dynamics
- **T005** (Morning run): Load Doogan, Baxter files; verify voice patterns and earpiece detail
- **T006** (Coffee meet): Load Doogan, Sebastian files; verify reading-people skills vs deception traits
- **T007** (Farmer's market): Load Doogan, Annabelle files; verify charm style and social intelligence
- **T008** (Team debrief): Load all four team members; verify four-way dynamics
- **T009** (Grocery store): Load Doogan, Annabelle files; verify charm deployment
- **T010** (Dinner/cliffhanger): Load Doogan, Martinez, Annabelle files; verify genuine-despite-con trait

**Implementation Principle Established:**
**CHARACTER FILES FIRST, PROSE SECOND**
- No scene writing begins until character files are loaded
- Character files are the canonical source for ALL character details
- Physical descriptions, possessions, habits, voice patterns, relationship dynamics come EXCLUSIVELY from element files
- Missing details stay vague or generic—no invention allowed
- Character fidelity is a checklist item, not optional

**Workflow Enforcement:**
1. **Before writing:** Load character files → Review relevant sections → Note canonical details → Note missing details
2. **During writing:** Check character detail checklist → Verify voice matches → Verify relationships match → No invented details
3. **After writing:** Verify all character details are from files or generic

**Prevention Mechanism:**
The pre-writing workflow creates a forcing function:
- Writer must actively engage with character files before prose
- Missing details become visible BEFORE they're invented
- Character voice patterns are fresh in mind during dialogue writing
- Relationship dynamics are explicitly reviewed before interactions

**Benefits:**
1. **Consistency:** All scenes pull from same canonical source
2. **Voice Accuracy:** Character speech patterns match established files
3. **Continuity:** No invented details to clean up later
4. **Efficiency:** Prevents rewrite cycles caused by character inconsistency
5. **Quality:** Richer characterization from using documented traits

**Future Application:**
- All new scenes must follow addscene.prompt.md workflow
- All scene rewrites must verify character file alignment
- Character file updates must be reflected in subsequent scenes
- Task creation for new scenes must include character file list

### Analysis Entry 6: 2024-12-24 — Scene 2 Rewrite: Thai Takeout & Job Framing Fix
**Focus:** Corrected two inconsistencies: Abby cooking Thai food (should be takeout) and job being framed as "different" (it's standard rich-guy-office situation)

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Abby Cooking:** Scene had Eddie saying "Abby's making that Thai curry thing" and Doogan responding to "Abby's cooking"
   - Problem: Thai food is typically takeout, not home-cooked
   - Character note needed: Abby knows how to cook but doesn't like to do it
2. **Job Framing:** Eddie described job as "different" requiring special discussion
   - Problem: This is a standard case (rich powerful man, office breakup situation)
   - Should be framed as usual type of job, not special/different

**Changes Made:**

**A. Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
- Removed initial dinner invite about "Abby's making that pasta thing" (streamlined opening)
- Changed "This one's... different" to "Rich guy, office situation. Usual thing."
- Changed "Abby's making that Thai curry thing" to "I'm ordering Thai"
- Changed "You bribing me with Abby's cooking now?" to "You bribing me with Thai food now?"
- Maintains same narrative function (Eddie bribing Doogan with food) but corrects the details

**B. Character File Updated:** `elements/characters/abby-palmer.md`
- Added to Background section: "She knows how to cook—and quite well—but doesn't particularly enjoy doing it. When the team gathers at her and Eddie's place, it's usually takeout (Thai, Italian, whatever Eddie orders). She saves her actual cooking for special occasions or when she's stress-baking (which she'll deny doing)."
- Marked source: "*(Established in Episode 1, Scene 2)*"

**C. Outline Updated:** `elements/outlines/episode-01.md`
- Scene 2 beats: Changed "different" to "rich guy, office situation, usual thing"
- Changed "Abby's Thai curry as bait" to "Thai food (ordering takeout)"

**D. Plan Updated:** `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/plan.md`
- Scene 2 key beats: "rich guy, office situation, usual thing" + "Thai takeout invitation"

**E. Tasks Updated:** `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/tasks.md`
- T003 acceptance criteria: updated job framing and takeout reference

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- Only Scene 2 affected (Scene 3 not yet written)
- No other scenes reference Abby's cooking habits yet
- Character detail now canonical for future reference

**Characterization Details Established:**
- **Abby's Cooking:** Knows how, doesn't like to do it regularly
- **Team Dinners:** Usually takeout when gathering at Eddie and Abby's
- **Job Type:** Standard rich-guy-office-situation (not special/different case)
- **Eddie's Bribery:** Uses food (takeout) to lure Doogan to meetings

**Narrative Benefits:**
1. **Realism:** Thai food is typically takeout in Southern California setting
2. **Character Consistency:** Abby manages operations but doesn't play domestic goddess
3. **Job Framing:** Properly establishes this as routine case type (sets up Sebastian's deception more effectively—it SHOULD be routine but something's off)
4. **Scene Economy:** Removed unnecessary rejected dinner invite, tightened opening

**Setup for Scene 3:**
- Doogan arrives expecting standard case (rich guy, receptionist situation)
- Thai takeout present (no cooking scene needed)
- Abby's presence for operations management, not because it's "different" case
- Audience and Doogan both expecting routine job—makes Sebastian's off-ness more effective

### Analysis Entry 7: 2024-12-24 — Scene 3 Major Rewrite: Voice, Style, and Setting Polish
**Focus:** Comprehensive rewrite of Scene 3 to fix voice, setting description, character presentation, and dialogue rhythm

**Issues Identified (from user feedback):**
1. **Weak Opening Line:** "Eddie's place smelled like lemongrass and poor decisions" - too precious, not Gregory McDonald style
2. **Abby's Outfit:** Yoga pants + cashmere sweater inappropriate for stylish SoCal woman with excellent taste
3. **Kitchen Description:** "lived-in" with "wedding photos on fridge, stack of unopened mail, comfortable mess" contradicts Abby's character (upper-middle-class upbringing, impeccable taste, "aggressive comfort" per character file)
4. **Eddie's Voice:** Didn't match character file's Vince Vaughn motor-mouth style - rapid-fire, never lets others finish, talks in spirals that land exactly where intended
5. **Dialogue Rhythm:** Too structured and back-and-forth, felt forced rather than natural banter

**Changes Made:**

**1. Opening Rewrite (McDonald Style):**
- Removed: "Eddie's place smelled like lemongrass and poor decisions"
- Replaced with: Immediate dialogue - Eddie talking BEFORE Doogan clears doorway
- Opens with Eddie mid-monologue: "There he is! The man, the myth, the legend. Come in, come in, food's getting cold..."
- Gregory McDonald opens with action/dialogue, disappears as author - reader eavesdrops

**2. Abby's Outfit (SoCal Elevated Style):**
- Removed: "yoga pants and a cashmere sweater"
- Replaced with: "silk blouse the color of champagne, tailored linen pants, gold jewelry that caught the pendant lights"
- Added: "Even at home, she looked ready for a magazine shoot"
- Consistent with character file: "impeccable, expensive casual," "always looks camera-ready even at 7 AM"

**3. Kitchen Setting (Modern, Stylish):**
- Removed: "warm, lived-in—wedding photos on the fridge, a stack of unopened mail, the comfortable mess of two people who actually liked sharing space"
- Replaced with: "white quartz countertops, brushed nickel fixtures, the kind of carefully curated space that looked effortless but cost serious money. Thai takeout containers lined the marble island like soldiers awaiting inspection"
- Reflects Abby's character: upper-middle-class upbringing, excellent taste, not "comfortable mess"

**4. Eddie's Voice (Vince Vaughn Motor-Mouth):**
- Restructured ALL Eddie dialogue to match character file style guide
- Added: Talking before Doogan arrives, rapid-fire tangents, doesn't let others finish sentences
- Example: "—and I'm just going to get right into it because I've been sitting on this all day and Abby keeps making that face like I'm hiding something, which, technically, yes, I was waiting for you, but that's not hiding, that's strategic timing—"
- Matches: "stream-of-consciousness delivery," "fire hose of charm, anecdotes, pitches, and tangents"
- Added Eddie eating spring roll while talking (physical business)
- Extended scout tangent: "There was an incident involving a campfire and a can of aerosol—you know what, not relevant"

**5. Dialogue Rhythm (Natural Banter):**
- Removed structured back-and-forth
- Added interruptions and overlapping thoughts
- Eddie steamrolls through objections
- Abby's interjections are sharp and quick
- Doogan's responses shorter, more measured (contrast to Eddie's motor-mouth)
- Added Abby/Eddie dynamic: "those are the same thing when you do them" / "They're not. They're related but distinct concepts"

**Character File Compliance Verification:**
- ✅ **Eddie:** Motor-mouth verified, rapid-fire tangents, sports metaphors absent but style matches Vince Vaughn energy
- ✅ **Abby:** Sarcastically loving, sharp observations, impeccable appearance, calls Eddie "Palmer" when crossing line
- ✅ **Doogan:** Measured responses, skeptical, reluctant agreement, doesn't waste words
- ✅ **Trio dynamic:** Eddie sells, Abby teases, Doogan assesses - per element files

**Word Count:** ~700 words (within 500-700 target range)

**Element Files Impact:**
- No changes to element files needed - rewrite uses only canonical information
- All details align with existing character files

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- Scene 3 standalone; no downstream scenes affected
- Scene 2 setup remains consistent (Thai food invitation, evening timing)
- Scene 4 setup preserved (meeting tomorrow, Duke's Coffee, 10 AM)

**Status:** Scene 3 rewrite complete. Voice and style now match character files and project style guide.

### Analysis Entry 5: 2024-12-24 — Scene 4 Backstory Correction: First Job Event Alignment
**Focus:** Corrected Scene 4 to use canonical first job details from `elements/events/the-first-job.md`
**Issue Identified:**
- Scene 4 invented first job backstory that contradicted the canonical event file
- Scene described: secretly engaged woman in sorority whose family had money, his didn't, waiting until graduation to announce
- Event file describes: VP of fraternity secretly engaged to wealthy family friend's daughter (with job promise), hooking up with sorority girl all semester
- The stories were completely different - scene inverted the key elements

**Changes Made:**

**1. Scene 4 Rewrite (`content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/04-morning-run.md`):**
- **Corrected backstory to match event file:**
  - VP of fraternity (trust fund kid) is the one with the secret engagement
  - VP hooking up with sorority girl all semester
  - VP's fiancée is wealthy family friend's daughter who promises him job after graduation
  - Sorority girl doesn't know about engagement; fiancée doesn't know about sorority girl
  - VP panicking about clean exit without risking engagement or career
  - Eddie spots opportunity, pitches Doogan as solution
  - Doogan and Eddie both broke (rent due, Cougar needs transmission)
  - Doogan charms sorority girl, she forgets VP entirely
  - Girl tells VP she's grateful, wishes him well in marriage
  - Eddie wants to make it regular, Doogan says no, they do it anyway post-graduation
- **Maintained scene structure:** Running action, Baxter's intel delivery, farmer's market location, poodle detail
- **Preserved voice:** Doogan's measured drawl, self-deprecating humor, class tension awareness
- **Added thematic consistency:** "broke kids outsmarting rich guy's problem" from event file

**2. Prompt File Updates:**

**`addscene.prompt.md` Updated:**
- Added `elements/events/` to Pre-Writing Workflow Step 1 (now "Load Character Files & Event Context")

  - Read complete event file from `elements/events/<event-name>.md`
  - Use canonical details (characters, setting, sequence)
  - DO NOT invent or alter event details
  - Maintain timeline and outcome consistency
- Added `elements/events/` to Inputs section with note: "canonical past event details - USE THESE for backstory references"

**`implement.prompt.md` Updated:**

- Added: "CRITICAL: Story details match `elements/events/the-first-job.md` exactly"
- Updated status note: "Completed 2024-12-24 (rewritten to match event file)"

**Element Files Impact:**
- No changes to element files needed - event file was already canonical
- Scene now correctly references existing canonical event

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- Scene 4 is the ONLY scene that references the first job backstory in Episode 1
- No other scenes affected by this correction
- Consistency now maintained between scene and canonical event file

**Prompt & Process Impact:**
- All future scenes referencing past events will now check `elements/events/` folder first

- Prompts now enforce this workflow in pre-writing verification
- This prevents continuity breaks and reduces cleanup work

**Status:** Scene 4 corrected to canonical event file. Prompts updated to prevent future event/backstory contradictions.

### Analysis Entry 8: 2024-12-24 — Scene 6 Rewrite: Dog Name, Bacon, and Banter Polish
**Focus:** Corrected Scene 6 to match established continuity and improve quality
**Issues Identified:**
1. Dog named "Precious" was incorrect—Scene 4 established dog's name as "Coco" (Baxter's intel)
2. "Precious" was a Silence of the Lambs joke in Scene 4, not the actual name
3. Opening was weak (missile metaphor, "examining" line)
4. Annabelle discovering bacon in Doogan's pocket was too obvious
5. Excessive Baxter involvement detracted from Doogan/Annabelle chemistry
6. Scene lacked sufficient banter to establish romantic chemistry

**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/06-farmers-market.md`
  - Dog renamed from "Precious" to "Coco" (canonical from Scene 4)
  - Rewrote opening: smoother start, no missile metaphor
  - Bacon now secret: Doogan feeds dog discreetly while Annabelle approaches
  - Annabelle never notices or mentions bacon
  - Removed almost all Baxter involvement (minimal to none)
  - Extended banter throughout: tomato jokes, produce humor, family name backstory
  - Better chemistry arc: natural progression from awkward → interested → invitation
  - Doogan's strategic exit preserved but executed through dialogue, not internal explanation
  - Added "handsome stranger" beat as clear mutual interest marker
  - Ending strengthened: "Same time next week?" creates anticipation without forced coffee date

**Continuity Verification:**
- ✅ Dog name "Coco" matches Scene 4 (Baxter: "The poodle's name is Coco")
- ✅ Bacon callback preserved (from Scene 5—Sebastian's plate)
- ✅ Stanford hoodie mentioned (Annabelle's detail, generic university choice)
- ✅ Coffee vendor callback maintained (Baxter's intel about her Instagram)
- ✅ Doogan's family/Southern background woven in naturally
- ✅ Sebastian's lack of knowledge reinforced at end

**Checklist Compliance:**
- ✅ McDonald opening style (action first—dog appears)
- ✅ No atmospheric openers
- ✅ First-person POV maintained
- ✅ Dialogue-driven (80%+ dialogue)
- ✅ Doogan's charm: playful, not predatory; accidentally effective
- ✅ No invented character details—all from element files or left vague
- ✅ Scene break marker at end

**Content Impact Analysis:**
- No other scenes affected by dog name change
- Scene 7 (debrief) may reference market encounter—will match naturally
- Continuity with Scene 4 now correct

**Quality Impact:**
- Scene 6 substantially improved
- Better romantic chemistry
- More authentic banter
- Cleaner opening
- Stronger McDonald-style execution
- Word count: ~850 words (slightly over target but justified by additional banter)

**Status:** Scene 6 rewritten. Continuity with Scene 4 (dog name) corrected. Quality improved.

### Analysis Entry: 2024-12-24 — Scene 7 Rewrite: Invented Research Results Violation
**Focus:** Corrected invented employer detail that undermined mystery storyline
**Issue Identified:**
- Scene 7 had Baxter reporting: "LinkedIn says she works for a consulting firm—Meridian Partners"
- This detail was INVENTED—no such employer exists in any element file
- Direct contradiction: Baxter says she's "weirdly clean" then provides specific employer
- Mystery integrity violation: Annabelle is MEANT to be hard to research
- Invented employment detail undermines entire storyline premise

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- AI generated research results without checking element files
- No "Meridian Partners" in villain.md or any other file
- No LinkedIn employer information documented anywhere
- Scene premise (mystery target hard to find) contradicted by invented specifics

**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/07-meet-cute-debrief.md`
  - Removed: "LinkedIn says she works for a consulting firm—Meridian Partners"
  - Replaced with: "LinkedIn exists but it's basically empty—no job listed, no connections, nothing useful"
  - Added: "And if she's his receptionist, where's the job info? Most people at least list where they work."
  - Result: Research now correctly returns EMPTY for mystery target
  - Absence of information now serves the mystery (suspicious that there's nothing)

**Prompt Files Updated:**
- `.github/prompts/addscene.prompt.md`:
  - Added new "Step 4: Research/Investigation Integrity Check" section
  - Added "RESEARCH RESULTS RULES" with explicit prohibitions
  - Added "THE MYSTERY INTEGRITY TEST" verification questions
  - Made clear that empty research results are valid and often correct

- `.github/prompts/implement.prompt.md`:
  - Added new "CRITICAL: RESEARCH/INVESTIGATION SCENES" section
  - Explicit instruction that missing info = empty research results
  - Emphasized checking "What Team Knows & When" sections

- `elements/checklist.md`:
  - Added new "Research/Investigation Scene Rules" section
  - Seven rules explicitly prohibiting invented research results
  - Made clear that absence of information IS plot-relevant

**Canonical Information Status:**
- Annabelle Anders: NO employer documented in element files
- Annabelle Anders: NO LinkedIn profile content documented
- Per villain.md "What Team Knows & When": Team knows almost nothing about her at this point
- Empty research results are story-correct and mystery-serving

**Lesson Learned:**
When characters research other characters in mystery plots:
1. ALWAYS check element files for what's actually documented
2. If it's not in element files, research comes up EMPTY
3. Mystery targets being hard to find is INTENTIONAL
4. Inventing research results creates major plot/continuity problems
5. "Can't find anything" is often the correct answer

**Status:** Scene 7 corrected. Prompts updated with new safeguards. Checklist updated with research rules.

### Analysis Entry: 2024-12-24 — Scene 7 Full Rewrite: Continuity, Flow, and Character Voice
**Focus:** Complete rewrite to fix continuity errors, restore character voices, and improve scene flow

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Thai food continuity error:** Scene had Doogan eating pad thai, but Thai food was from Scene 3 (previous night). Scene 7 takes place same day as farmer's market (Scenes 4-6).
2. **Eddie's voice completely wrong:** Dialogue was structured turn-taking with short responses—violates motor-mouth rules. Eddie needs Vince Vaughn rapid-fire delivery.
3. **Scene flow flat:** Lost the urgency per outline ("Doogan just came from farmer's market to ask why there's so little background work").
4. **Setting not established:** Should be Eddie & Abby's kitchen but lacked their signature home environment details.
5. **Character dynamics lost:** Scene 3 shows proper three-way banter. Scene 7 had none of that energy.

**Changes Made:**
- **Removed:** All Thai food references (pad thai, spring roll). Timeline-incorrect.
- **Rewrote Eddie's dialogue:** Added motor-mouth patterns:
  - Opens mid-monologue about "leaving first" strategy
  - Multiple tangents that circle back
  - Steamrolls other characters
  - Self-interrupting rhetorical questions ("right?")
  - Rare pauses now carry weight
- **Added kitchen setting details:** Brass fixtures, white quartz, fresh flowers, late morning sun (matches Abby's Home Environment Rules)
- **Improved four-way dynamics:**
  - Eddie: motor-mouth optimist defending the job
  - Abby: sarcastic conscience, sides with Doogan
  - Doogan: measured, direct, concerned
  - Baxter: tech-focused, earnest, starstruck
- **Strengthened Abby's voice:** Added Leslie Mann rapid-fire wit, expressive eyebrow moment
- **Better scene rhythm:** More overlapping dialogue, interruptions, energy
- **Ending rewritten:** Abby's observation about Doogan liking Annabelle—creates tension for future scenes

**Continuity Verification:**
- ✅ No food references that conflict with timeline
- ✅ Kitchen setting matches Abby's documented home style
- ✅ Character voices match element files
- ✅ Research results still empty (no invented details)
- ✅ Timeline flows properly from Scene 6 (farmer's market)
- ✅ Baxter's bacon callback correct (from Scene 5)

**Checklist Compliance:**
- ✅ McDonald opening (Eddie already talking mid-sentence)
- ✅ First-person POV maintained
- ✅ Dialogue-driven (85%+ dialogue)
- ✅ Eddie motor-mouth patterns enforced
- ✅ Abby's voice matches Leslie Mann style
- ✅ Doogan's measured drawl preserved
- ✅ Scene break marker at end

**No Element Files Updated:** No new canonical details added. All details used were already in element files.

**Quality Impact:**
- Scene 7 substantially improved
- Character voices now match element specifications
- Timeline continuity corrected
- Better energy and flow
- Word count: ~880 words (within reasonable range)

**Status:** Scene 7 fully rewritten. Continuity fixed. Character voices restored.

### Analysis Entry: 2024-12-24 — Scene 7 Rewrite #2: Structure and Focus
**Focus:** Restructure scene to emphasize Eddie/Abby dynamics over Baxter, restore original opening concept

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Opening lost impact:** The motor-mouth opening about "leaving first" was overwritten. User preferred original "You left?" opening where Eddie doesn't understand why Doogan left without closing.
2. **Baxter too prominent:** Four-way scene became cluttered. Baxter should have minimal role—just providing transaction info.
3. **Scene objective unclear:** Real goal is getting Doogan the intel (Monday night grocery trips) to plan next encounter.
4. **Timeline wrong:** Next encounter should be Monday night at Gelsons, not "Saturday at farmer's market."
5. **Abby's role undersold:** Needed more focus on Abby mocking BOTH the concept (rebounding a receptionist) AND the business model itself.

**Changes Made:**
- **Restored "You left?" opening:** Eddie incredulous that Doogan walked away without closing
- **Added Doogan explaining strategy:** Leave them curious, hoping to see you again. Patience.
- **Reduced Baxter to minimal role:** Just reports transaction patterns showing Monday night Gelsons trips
- **Strengthened Eddie/Abby dynamic:**
  - Eddie ensuring Doogan stays on task
  - Abby insulting both of them throughout
  - Abby mocking the "rebounding a receptionist" concept explicitly
  - Abby attacking the business model ("service to people who don't know they're receiving it")
- **Fixed next encounter timing:** Monday night at Gelsons (6pm) per Baxter's intel
- **Better scene pacing:** Cleaner three-way dynamic (Eddie/Doogan/Abby) with Baxter as brief info source
- **Stronger ending:** "The problem wasn't whether I could do this. The problem was whether I should."

**T009 Task Updated:**
- Added new opening requirement: Eddie in earpiece relaying Sebastian's status request
- Doogan responds he's meeting her tonight, spots Annabelle entering for Monday dinner trip
- Setting established as Monday evening at Gelsons grocery store

**Continuity Notes:**
- Scene 7 now establishes Monday night Gelsons pattern
- Scene 8 will open Monday evening with Eddie earpiece/Sebastian status update
- Timeline: Scene 6 (Saturday market) → Scene 7 (same day debrief) → Scene 8 (Monday evening)

**Checklist Compliance:**
- ✅ McDonald opening (Eddie's "You left?" in media res)
- ✅ First-person POV maintained
- ✅ Dialogue-driven (90%+ dialogue)
- ✅ Eddie still has motor-mouth energy but balanced with reactions
- ✅ Abby's voice sharp, mocking, conscience-driven
- ✅ Doogan's measured responses, strategy explanation
- ✅ Baxter minimal role (just intel delivery)
- ✅ Scene break marker at end

**Word count:** ~850 words

**Status:** Scene 7 rewritten with proper focus. T009 updated for Scene 8 opening.

---

### Analysis Entry: 2024-12-24 — Scene 7 Rewrite #3: Dialogue Trimming and Canonical Details
**Focus:** Tighten exposition, redirect explanations to Baxter, fix canonical details about Annabelle's patterns

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Exposition too long:** The rebounding/social engineering explanation felt introductory for characters who've known each other for years
2. **Wrong shopping pattern:** Said "Monday nights, weekly dinner run" but Annabelle shops for dinner every night (almost every night, 5x/week)
3. **Knew her address:** Scene said store was "two blocks from her building" but they CAN'T find her physical address—everything routes to PO Box
4. **Missing employment verification:** At this point, team has no reason to suspect she doesn't work at Emergence Medical Billing—should ask about it

**Changes Made:**
- **Redirected explanation to Baxter:** Eddie explains the "leaving first" strategy to Baxter as the newer team member, which makes the exposition feel natural
- **Shortened Eddie/Abby argument:** Cut repetitive back-and-forth; kept Abby's sharp "cognitive dissonance keeps me sharp" line
- **Fixed shopping pattern:** Changed from "Monday nights" to "almost every night, at least five times a week"—per canonical detail that Annabelle shops for dinner daily
- **Removed address knowledge:** They know she shops at Gelsons but explicitly CAN'T find her physical address (PO Box only)—this is mystery-correct
- **Added employment check:** Doogan asks about Emergence Medical Billing connection; Baxter explains no public employee info but that's normal for medical billing companies—team accepts Sebastian's story at this point
- **Tightened ending:** Removed over-explained introspection, kept punchy exit

**Continuity Corrections:**
- ✅ Annabelle shops nightly for dinner (not weekly)
- ✅ Team cannot find her physical address (PO Box only)
- ✅ Team has no reason to doubt Emergence Medical Billing connection yet
- ✅ Baxter positioned as newer team member learning the business

**Checklist Compliance:**
- ✅ McDonald opening preserved ("You just left?")
- ✅ First-person POV maintained
- ✅ Dialogue-driven (90%+ dialogue)
- ✅ Character voices match—Baxter asking naive questions, Eddie mentoring, Abby cutting through BS
- ✅ No invented details—all info matches element files or stays appropriately vague
- ✅ Scene break marker at end

**Word count:** ~750 words (tightened from ~850)

**Status:** Scene 7 rewritten. Canonical details corrected. Dialogue focused and natural.

### Analysis Entry: 2025-01-XX — POV Conversion: First-Person to Third-Person Close (Gregory McDonald Style)
**Focus:** Comprehensive POV rewrite converting all content from first-person to third-person close with first-person "feel"

**Research Conducted:**
- Fetched Wikipedia article on Gregory McDonald and Fletch novels
- Fetched MasterClass writing guide on POV techniques
- Key discovery: Fletch novels are written in THIRD-PERSON CLOSE (not first-person as commonly assumed)
- The "first-person feel" comes from: 80-90% dialogue dominance, no interior monologue, no "he thought/felt", tight psychic distance, behavioral focus

**Gregory McDonald's POV Technique (The Fletch Style):**
- Uses "Fletch said," "He noticed" (third-person pronouns)
- Reader feels first-person because: almost no authorial commentary, dialogue reveals character, reader learns when protagonist learns

- Camera follows protagonist exclusively (protagonist-centric)
- No villain POV, no omniscient breaks

**Conversion Rules Established:**
1. "I" → "Doogan" or "He" (context-dependent)

- `elements/outlines/episode-02.md` — Same as above
- `elements/outlines/episode-03.md` — Same as above

**Content Files Converted (8 total):**

1. **`01-the-dumping.md`** — Full conversion
   - All "I" → "Doogan"/"He"
   - All "my" → "his"

**Impact on Future Writing:**
- All new scenes must use third-person close
- No interior monologue (show through action/dialogue)
- Maintain 80-90% dialogue ratio
- Open scenes with action or dialogue (never atmospheric description)
- Use "Doogan said" or "He said" (never "I said")
- Pass the eavesdropper test before finalizing

**Status:** POV conversion complete. All guide files and content files updated. Project now uses Gregory McDonald-style third-person close with first-person feel.

### Analysis Entry: 2024-12-24 — Scene 8 Major Rewrite: Continuity Violations and Detail Fabrication
**Focus:** Corrected multiple critical continuity errors and fabricated details in Scene 8

**Critical Issues Identified:**

1. **Dog Present in Grocery Store (MAJOR ERROR)**
   - Scene had Annabelle's dog Coco in the grocery store with her
   - Context: Annabelle is shopping Monday evening on her way home from work (receptionist job)
   - **Reality:** Dog would be at her apartment, not in a grocery store
   - **Violation:** Invented circumstance that doesn't match real-world logic or character situation

2. **Dog Name Fabricated (CONTINUITY VIOLATION)**
   - Scene called the dog "Brutus" (twice: lines 63 and 197)
   - **Canonical fact (Scene 4):** Dog's name is **Coco** (Baxter's intel: "The poodle's name is Coco")
   - **Root cause:** Failed to check Scene 4 before writing Scene 8

3. **Bacon Discovery Breaks Secret (PLOT VIOLATION)**
   - Scene had Annabelle say: "You had bacon in your pocket"
   - **Canonical fact (Scene 6):** Doogan fed Coco bacon "discreetly while he kept his eyes on the approaching owner"
   - **Explicit setup:** Annabelle was NOT supposed to notice the bacon—it was a secret
   - **Impact:** Ruins the "why does the dog like him" mystery/charm

4. **Living Nearby Lie (CHARACTER STRATEGY ERROR)**
   - Scene had Doogan claim: "I live four blocks from here. This is my grocery store."
   - **Problem:** If they date longer (as intended), she'd discover this lie when visiting his place
   - **Better strategy:** Joke about the tomatoes ("I heard they had good tomatoes here")
   - **Character consistency:** Doogan doesn't tell easily-discoverable lies

5. **POV Inconsistencies (TECHNICAL ERROR)**
   - Residual first-person pronouns remained: "I didn't respond," "me" in "reach me," "We were both," "We walked," "We crossed"
   - **Should be:** third-person close throughout

6. **Timeline Clarity**
   - Scene needed stronger establishment that this is Monday evening per Scene 7 intel

**Changes Made:**

**A. Scene 8 Complete Rewrite (`content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/08-tomato-aisle.md`):**

1. **Removed dog entirely:**
   - Dog not present in grocery store
   - Annabelle arrives alone (shopping on way home from work)
   - Opening: "he'd spotted her—Stanford hoodie, yoga pants, Monday evening dinner run just like Baxter predicted"

2. **Removed all bacon references:**
   - Deleted: "He's been fixated on you since Saturday" (no dog present)
   - Deleted: "You had bacon in your pocket" dialogue
   - Deleted: "I frequently have bacon in my pocket" response
   - Bacon callback preserved only in Scene 6 where it belongs

3. **Changed Doogan's approach:**
   - Removed: "I live four blocks from here" lie
   - Replaced with: "I heard they had good tomatoes here." (joking, self-aware)
   - Annabelle: "You drove to a grocery store because someone said they had good tomatoes?"
   - Doogan: "You don't?" / Annabelle: "No. Normal people do not do that." / Doogan: "Your loss."
   - More charming, less suspicious, no easily-discoverable lie

4. **Fixed all POV inconsistencies:**
   - "I didn't respond" → "Doogan didn't respond"
   - "reach me" → stays correct (Baxter can reach Doogan)
   - "We were both" → "They were both"
   - "We walked" → "They walked"
   - "We crossed" → "They crossed"

5. **Removed dog name references:**
   - No "Brutus" (incorrect name)
   - No "Coco" (dog not present)
   - Eliminated entire problem

6. **Maintained story beats:**
   - Eddie's status call opening (preserved)
   - Tomato browsing (preserved)
   - Baxter switching in on comms (preserved)
   - Risotto conversation and chemistry (preserved)
   - Annabelle's invitation (preserved)
   - Baxter's amazement (preserved)
   - Crossing to her building (preserved, just without dog)

**Continuity Verification Post-Rewrite:**

- ✅ **Scene 4 compatibility:** Coco's name established there; Scene 8 no longer contradicts
- ✅ **Scene 6 compatibility:** Bacon fed discreetly; Scene 8 no longer reveals it
- ✅ **Scene 7 compatibility:** Monday evening Gelsons pattern confirmed; Scene 8 reflects this
- ✅ **Real-world logic:** Dog stays home while owner shops on way from work
- ✅ **Character strategy:** Doogan doesn't tell easily-discoverable lies
- ✅ **POV consistency:** All third-person close, no first-person slips

**Root Cause Analysis:**

Scene 8 was written without systematically checking:
1. Previous scenes for established details (dog's name in Scene 4)
2. Previous scenes for plot setup (bacon secret in Scene 6)
3. Logical real-world constraints (dog in grocery store while owner at work)
4. Character strategy implications (lie easily discovered if relationship continues)
5. POV conversion completion (residual first-person pronouns)

**Prevention Measures Needed:**

The prompts (`addscene.prompt.md` and `implement.prompt.md`) need stronger enforcement:
1. **MUST read ALL previous scenes in same episode before writing new scene**
2. **MUST verify every detail against existing content files**
3. **MUST check real-world logic for invented circumstances**
4. **MUST consider downstream implications of character statements**
5. **MUST verify POV consistency after any edits**

**Lesson Learned:**

This rewrite demonstrates why the comprehensive checking workflow in rewrite.prompt.md exists. When writing later scenes in an episode:
- Every detail must be cross-checked against earlier scenes
- Fabricated details (dog's name, bacon discovery) create cascading errors
- Logical real-world constraints (dog + grocery store) must be verified
- Character strategy must align with long-term plot needs (no easily-discoverable lies)
- POV conversion must be complete before considering a scene "done"

**Status:** Scene 8 rewritten with all continuity violations corrected. Prompts will be updated to prevent similar issues.

### Analysis Entry: 2024-12-24 — Scene 8 Rewrite #2: Character Motivation and Technical Details
**Focus:** Corrected Annabelle's emotional state, clothing, and added Baxter's real-time intel mechanic

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Clothing Inconsistency:**
   - Scene had Annabelle in "Stanford hoodie, yoga pants" (casual weekend attire)
   - **Context:** Monday evening, coming from work at receptionist job
   - **Should be:** Office attire (professional but not stuffy)

2. **Emotional Tone Wrong:**
   - Scene portrayed Annabelle as suspicious/guarded ("concern about running into you twice")
   - **Reality:** She was hoping to see him again (pleasant surprise, not suspicious)
   - **Backstory:** She's been social media stalking Doogan via Baxter's Instagram profile
   - **Truth:** She likes what she sees but won't admit to stalking him online

3. **Risotto Guess Mechanics Unclear:**
   - Scene had Doogan making "educated guess" about shrimp risotto
   - **Reality:** Baxter feeds him real-time intel through the earpiece
   - **How it works:** Annabelle mentions Providence → Baxter instantly searches and finds risotto info → feeds it to Doogan → Doogan appears psychic

**Changes Made:**

**A. Scene 8 Updated (`content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/08-tomato-aisle.md`):**

1. **Changed Annabelle's clothing:**
   - Removed: "Stanford hoodie, yoga pants"
   - Replaced with: "office attire, professional but not stuffy"
   - Added context: "Dinner run on the way home from work"

2. **Changed Annabelle's emotional tone:**
   - Opening: "and smiling. Actually smiling, not the guarded expression from the farmer's market"
   - Changed: "concern about running into you twice" → "Still shopping for tomatoes, I see. This is becoming a pattern." (playful, not suspicious)
   - Changed: "Her tone was light, but there was an edge to it" → "Her tone was lighter than Saturday. Almost playful."
   - Changed: "Not quite a smile, but the possibility of one" → she's already smiling from the start
   - Changed: "She crossed her arms" → "She crossed her arms, but she was still smiling"

3. **Added Baxter's real-time intel delivery:**
   - When Annabelle says "Providence, I guess"
   - Baxter immediately cuts in: "Providence is known for their risotto according to this Yelp review—shrimp, I guess—and it's all over their social media."
   - Doogan then asks about risotto, appears to guess shrimp
   - Annabelle's reaction: "How did you—" (amazed, not creeped out)
   - Changed: "very impressive or very unsettling" → "really impressive or really creepy" (lighter tone)

4. **Changed ending emotional note:**
   - Removed: "The edge was still there. That flicker of calculation behind her eyes."
   - Removed: "She didn't entirely trust this. And she shouldn't. Neither did he."
   - Replaced with: "The way she kept glancing at him, like she'd already looked him up. Like she'd hoped she'd run into him again."
   - Added: "Maybe Baxter's Instagram work was paying off."
   - New ending: "She didn't entirely trust this. But she wanted to. And that was enough."

5. **Changed invitation framing:**
   - Changed: "Weighing something" → "Not weighing whether to trust him—weighing whether to admit she'd been hoping this would happen"

**B. Character File Updated (`elements/characters/rodney-baxter.md`):**

Added three new entries to Humor & Style Notes:
1. **Social media craftsman:** Documents Baxter's creation of Doogan's Instagram profile (curated photos, believable posts, strategic details). Notes that Annabelle stalked this profile and liked what she saw. *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 8)*

2. **Real-time intel delivery:** Documents Baxter's ability to provide instant research through earpiece (restaurant reviews, social media details, background information). Notes this allows Doogan to appear psychic—crucial to his "magic tricks." *(Established in Episode 1, Scene 8)*

**Continuity Verification:**
- ✅ Clothing now matches context (work attire for post-work shopping)
- ✅ Emotional tone matches character motivation (hopeful, not suspicious)
- ✅ Baxter's intel mechanic now clearly shown (not just implied)
- ✅ Instagram backstory established (Annabelle researched him)
- ✅ Ending reflects her positive interest (not mutual distrust)

**Checklist Compliance:**
- ✅ POV maintained (third-person close)
- ✅ Dialogue-driven (80%+)
- ✅ McDonald opening style preserved
- ✅ Character voice consistent
- ✅ Real-world logic (office attire after work)
- ✅ Scene beats preserved (all outline requirements met)

**Technical Improvements:**
1. **Baxter's Role Clarified:** Now explicitly shows how Doogan's "psychic" abilities work (real-time research through earpiece)
2. **Social Engineering Setup:** Establishes that Baxter creates fake social media profiles as part of the con infrastructure
3. **Character Motivation Clear:** Annabelle's interest is genuine and growing, not paranoid

**Character Arc Impact:**
- Annabelle more actively interested (checked him out online, hoping to see him)
- Doogan's "magic" demystified for reader (shows the technical apparatus)
- Baxter's value to team demonstrated (not just research—active operational support)

**Status:** Scene 8 rewritten with correct character motivation, clothing, and technical details. Baxter character file updated with new operational capabilities.

### Analysis Entry 9: 2024-12-26 — Scene 2 Dialogue Fix: Opening Banter Rewrite
**Focus:** Fixed out-of-character "grading on a curve" exchange between Claire and Doogan
**Issue Identified:**
- Original dialogue: "Depends. Are you grading on a curve?" / "I'm a lawyer. I don't do curves." / "And yet you curved me."
- Problem: Academic/scholastic metaphor didn't fit Claire's confident, sophisticated character
- Felt juvenile for two adults in their late 30s/early 40s having a mature, warm goodbye
- Claire is direct and self-aware (per Scene 1); should own the moment, not deflect with conceptual wordplay

**Changes Made:**
- **Scene Updated:** `content/episodes/episode-01-the-receptionist/02-valet-sweet-goodbye.md`
  - New exchange focuses on Claire's profession (government attorney who "works an angle")
  - Added: "Nice enough that I'm already calculating whether I can expense it" (lawyer humor)
  - Claire directly acknowledges the dynamic: "You made a three-month relationship feel like exactly what I needed it to be. That's either a gift or a con."
  - Doogan: "Can't it be both?" (owns his ambiguity)
  - Keeps the sea turtle metaphor but frames it better: "A sea turtle who's suspiciously good at knowing exactly what to say"
- **Compiled Output Updated:** `output/TheReboundSpecialist-Episode01.md` (matched scene file)

**Character Consistency Analysis:**
- New dialogue better reflects Claire's established traits:
  - Confident and self-aware (owns what the relationship was)
  - Professional attorney mindset (expense joke, "working an angle" callback)
  - Emotionally mature (recognizes Doogan's gift/con duality)
  - Warm but clear about the goodbye (releasing him, not dismissing him)
- Doogan's response stays true to character:
  - Self-aware about what he does ("Can't it be both?")
  - Doesn't pretend innocence
  - Maintains charm without being defensive

**McDonald Mechanics:**
- Opening dialogue still fast-paced and witty
- Banter reveals character (lawyer brain, charmer awareness)
- No forced metaphors; references their actual dynamic
- Maintains warm tone appropriate for mature breakup

**Content Impact:**
- No other scenes reference this specific exchange
- Claire appears only in Episode 1, Scenes 1-2
- No element files needed updating (no new canonical details)
- Change improves character voice consistency

**Status:** Scene 2 dialogue fixed to better match character sophistication and relationship dynamic. Compiled output synchronized.

### Analysis Entry: 2024-12-26 — CRITICAL FIX: Restored Murder Frame-Up Plot Mechanics (Scenes 8-9)
**Focus:** Recovered essential plot elements lost during Stephen King craft feedback application
**Problem Identified:**
During feedback application focusing on craft (dialogue compression, sensory detail, pacing), two CRITICAL plot mechanics were accidentally removed:
1. **Scene 8:** Eddie's phone call where Doogan reports "meeting her tonight" - this call enables Sebastian to coordinate the murder timing
2. **Scene 9:** Drugged wine plot was compressed into instant sex scene, losing:
   - Wine consumed throughout cooking (20-30 minutes)
   - Progressive drug effects (Nexapan sedative)
   - Both victims becoming disoriented/woozy
   - Doogan blacking out BEFORE sex (innocence/frame-up)
   - Killer entering while both unconscious

**Why This Matters:**
- This is a **murder frame-up**, not a romance gone wrong
- Sebastian hired them to get Doogan close to Annabelle so he could have her killed and frame Doogan
- Without Eddie's call, Sebastian doesn't know when to send the killer
- Without the drugged wine timeline, the murder mechanics don't work
- Doogan must black out BEFORE sex to maintain innocence for the frame-up

**Changes Made:**

**Scene 8 (`08-tomato-aisle.md`) - RESTORED:**
- **OPENING:** Eddie's phone call: "Tell him I'm meeting her tonight"
- This is PLOT-CRITICAL - Sebastian needs timeline to coordinate killer
- Phone call must happen BEFORE Doogan spots Annabelle
- Enables the entire murder setup in Scene 9

**Scene 9 (`09-dinner-at-annabelles.md`) - COMPLETE REWRITE:**
- Wine introduced and drunk throughout scene (3-4 glasses each over 20-30 minutes)
- Progressive drug effects shown:
  - Initial pleasant buzz
  - Lightheadedness, difficulty focusing
  - Room tilting, words blurring
  - Loss of coordination (Annabelle swaying/knocking glass, Doogan's hands heavy)
  - Move toward bedroom but both increasingly disoriented
  - Doogan's knees buckle, vision blurs
  - **BLACKS OUT BEFORE ANY SEXUAL ACTIVITY**
- Hard cut to wake-up with detective and corpse
- Scene length increased from 400-600 words to 800-1,000 words to accommodate drug timeline

**Element Files Updated:**
1. `elements/notes.md`:
   - Added "The Murder Frame-Up Mechanics (Episode 1)" section
   - Documented Eddie phone call requirement
   - Documented drugged wine timeline and mechanics
   - Noted 30-40 minute timeline coordination

2. `elements/outlines/episode-01.md`:
   - Updated Scene 8 beats to include Eddie phone call at opening (marked CRITICAL)
   - Updated Scene 9 beats to include full drugged wine progression
   - Added extensive notes about drug effects, timing, and blackout before sex
   - Marked critical plot mechanics throughout

3. `drafts/001-episode-01-draft/plan.md`:
   - Updated Scene 8 specification to include Eddie phone call (PLOT-CRITICAL)
   - Updated Scene 9 specification with full drug timeline
   - Increased Scene 9 target length to 800-1,000 words
   - Added technical notes about progressive drug effects

**Continuity Verification:**
- Scene 8 Eddie call now properly sets up Scene 9 murder
- Drugged wine (Woodmark Vineyards) remains canonical clue for later episodes
- Doogan's innocence maintained (unconscious before sex)
- Frame-up mechanics now work correctly
- Timeline coordination between Sebastian and killer is now possible

**Lessons Learned:**
- Craft feedback (dialogue, pacing, sensory detail) must never override core plot mechanics
- Phone calls that seem like "Eddie rambling" may be mission-critical plot points
- Scene compression must preserve essential story beats even while cutting fat
- Always verify: Is this just dialogue bloat, or does it enable the plot?

**Status:** Critical plot mechanics restored. Murder frame-up now functions correctly. Scene 8 enables Scene 9. Drugged wine timeline is realistic and complete.
