Episode 1 Review: Craft Analysis (KingCraft Approach)
What Works
1. Dialogue Dominance — Strong
The episode commits to its McDonald-inspired dialogue-driven structure. Exchanges crackle with rhythm. Scene 1's breakup banter lands cleanly:

"Can I still get the bread basket refilled?"
Her laugh came quick and genuine. "God, I'm going to miss that."
"The bread basket?"

This is lean. Muscular. The jokes emerge from character, not authorial cleverness.

2. Scene Openings — Mostly Pass the Eavesdropper Test
Scene 3 opens mid-Eddie-ramble ("There he is! Fresh from a broken heart..."). Scene 4 drops us into Baxter mid-info-dump. Scene 5 catches Eddie mid-pitch. These work. The reader feels like they arrived late to a conversation already in progress.

3. Doogan's Voice — Consistent
Short responses. Dry delivery. Self-deprecating but not maudlin. He deflects with humor when things matter. The checklist says "measured drawl" and "never rambling"—the episode honors that.

4. The End Button — Sharp
The cliffhanger lands hard. Annabelle dead, Doogan waking next to her, detective over him. No fat. No overwriting. Just: Dead. Hands where I can see them. That's clean storytelling.

What Needs Tightening
1. Scene 3 — Abby's Wardrobe Violation
The checklist is explicit: Abby is NEVER in yoga pants around company. Yet:

"I eat the spring rolls," Abby said, emerging from the hallway.

No clothing description here—but later:

She slid onto a barstool, crossing her legs.

This is fine, but the bigger issue is the lack of visual anchoring for her elevated style. Per the character file, even at home she's in silk blouses, tailored linen, designer casual. A single beat—"She slid onto a barstool, wine in hand, her silk blouse catching the pendant light"—would reinforce the character bible without slowing the scene.

2. Adverb Creep
King's rule: The road to hell is paved with adverbs. Several sneak through:

"She set down her wine glass with the kind of precision..." — Fine.
"Her laugh came quick and genuine." — Adjectives, acceptable.
"Something clicked in his eyes." — Weak. What clicked? Show it.
"almost reluctantly" — Cut "almost." If it's reluctant, it's reluctant.
These are minor, but the aggregate effect softens the prose.

3. Scene 6 — Some Dialogue Gets Stagey
The farmer's market meet-cute has wonderful texture (Coco as icebreaker, bacon bribe, tomato banter), but a few exchanges feel over-constructed:

"I'm Annabelle."
"Doogan."
"That's unusual."
"Family name. My grandfather's, supposedly. Though my mother also said she was heavily medicated during labor, so the paperwork might be suspect."

The joke lands, but it's a lot of setup for a first meeting. King would say: Trust the reader. Don't explain the joke.

Consider trimming to:

"That's unusual."
"Family name. Mother was heavily medicated during labor."

Same beat. Less breath.

4. Scene 8 — The Risotto Scene Has Too Much Choreography
The grocery-to-bedroom progression works emotionally, but the narration over-documents the cooking:

"He heated the pan, started the shallots. The rhythm came naturally—dice, sauté, deglaze."

This is fine. But then:

"He added rice to the pan, stirred, let it toast."
"He added the first ladle of stock. The rice absorbed it hungrily."
"Doogan added more stock. Stirred. The risotto was silky now, coming together."

Three stock-and-stir beats. One would do. King's rewrite rule: Cut 10-20%. The risotto choreography could lose a ladle.

5. Scene 9 — The Morning After is Rushed
The shift from intimacy to corpse happens fast—which is fine structurally—but the domestic details before the reveal feel thin. The bedroom scene has:

"She was telling him about her first apartment, the one with the radiator that sounded like a dying animal, and he was telling her about the Cougar's transmission problems..."

This is summary, not scene. If this intimacy matters (and it should—it's the emotional counterweight to the horror ending), give it one concrete moment. One sensory detail. King's childhood snapshots: the radiator that sounds like a dying animal is good—but we don't hear it. We're told about it. Show one beat:

"The radiator in my first place," she said. "It sounded like a goat being strangled."
"The Cougar's transmission makes the same noise."
"We should introduce them."

Then cut to Afterward, she traced patterns on his chest. That's one exchange. Six seconds of reading. But now the intimacy is earned.

6. POV Slip in Scene 9

"Someone tapped his forehead."

Doogan is asleep. The tap wakes him. But the narration describes it as if he's aware of it before he's awake. This is a small POV wobble. Clean fix:

Doogan opened his eyes. A man stood over him. Badge. Hard expression.

Cut the tap. He wakes to the detective already there. Cleaner. More disorienting. Better matches the horror of the moment.

Structural Notes
Pacing: Strong. Nine scenes, each with a clear purpose. The episode moves.

Hook/Turn/Button Structure:

Hook: The breakup dinner (establishes Doogan's charm, hints at the job)
Turn: The bedroom scene (Doogan crosses a line—or does he?)
Button: Annabelle dead, Doogan framed
This is textbook serial fiction structure. Solid.

Character Consistency:

Eddie's motor-mouth: ✅ (Scene 3 is perfect Eddie)
Doogan's measured responses: ✅
Abby's sharpness: ✅ (though her visual presence could be stronger)
Baxter's enthusiasm: ✅
Summary: What to Fix
Priority	Issue	Fix
Medium	Scene 3: Abby lacks visual anchoring	Add one clothing/style beat
Low	Adverb creep	Cut "almost reluctantly," tighten "something clicked"
Low	Scene 6: Name-origin joke overwritten	Trim the mother/medication line
Medium	Scene 8: Risotto over-choreographed	Cut 1-2 stock-and-stir beats
High	Scene 9: Intimacy is summarized, not shown	Add one concrete dialogue exchange
Low	Scene 9: POV slip on the forehead tap	Cut the tap, start with eyes open
Verdict
This episode is good. The voice is consistent, the dialogue crackles, and the ending lands. The bones are solid.

What it needs is one more pass with a scalpel: trim the choreography, sharpen the intimacy, add one visual beat for Abby. King's 10-20% rule applies—not to gut the episode, but to make every sentence work harder.

The story earns its cliffhanger. Now tighten the lead-up so the punch hits even harder.
