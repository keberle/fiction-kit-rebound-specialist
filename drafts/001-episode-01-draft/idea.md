# Draft Idea (Intent Spec)

**Draft:** 001-episode-01-draft
**Created:** 2024-12-24

## Intent Summary
Create the first full draft of Episode 1 ("The Receptionist") from the existing outline. This draft will introduce Doogan Andrews, his "rebound specialist" business, the supporting cast (Eddie, Abby, Baxter), and the inciting crime that launches the series. The episode needs to deliver a complete narrative arc while establishing the show's tone—fast, witty, satirical—and hook readers for the serial format with a strong cliffhanger.

## Motivation
The outline for Episode 1 exists with detailed scene breakdowns, character profiles, POV rules, tone guidelines, and checklist requirements. All foundation materials are in place. This draft is needed to transform that structural blueprint into actual prose that captures the voice, pacing, and humor that define The Rebound Specialist as a series.

## Scope
- **Affected outline/scenes/files:** `elements/outlines/episode-01.md` (9 scenes from Prologue through final cliffhanger)
- **Characters involved:** Doogan Andrews, Eddie Palmer, Abby Palmer, Rodney "Baxter" Baxter, "Sebastian LeClere" (villain persona), Annabelle Anders, Detective Paul Martinez
- **Settings involved:** Restaurant (prologue), valet/parking lot, Eddie's office/briefing location, neighborhood running route, Duke's Coffee, farmer's market, Annabelle's condo
- **Expected output:** Full prose draft of Episode 1 in `content/` (exact file path TBD during planning stage)

## Desired Outcome
A complete, publishable first installment that:
- Introduces Doogan's profession and moral code through action, not exposition
- Establishes the trio dynamic (Doogan/Eddie/Abby) and Baxter's role
- Delivers the "first job" origin story naturally through the Baxter running scene
- Creates chemistry between Doogan and Annabelle that feels earned
- Lands the cliffhanger with maximum impact (Doogan waking up beside a corpse)
- Maintains Fletch-style POV (first-person for Doogan scenes; no villain scenes, no omniscient narration)
- Hits tone requirements: fast, witty, satirical, with dark edges handled through humor
- Complies with all checklist requirements (dialogue-driven, tags/beats, The Fletch Rule, etc.)

## Constraints / Non‑Negotiables
Beyond `elements/checklist.md`:
- Episode length: 2,000–6,000 words (target ~4,500–5,500 for pilot)
- Every scene must advance plot or character; no filler
- The client "Sebastian LeClere" must feel subtly wrong without being obviously villainous
- Doogan's charm with Annabelle cannot feel predatory; playful and curious, not polished-salesman
- The wine bottle detail (Woodmark Vineyards) is a planted clue
- Blackout/wake-up transition must be abrupt and disorienting
- Maintain first-person POV throughout; reader learns when Doogan learns

## Serial Beat Requirements
- **Hook (Cold Open):** Prologue breakup scene that feels weirdly successful—introduce Doogan's job and charm in one clean beat
- **Escalation/Turn:** Doogan's instincts telling him something's wrong with Sebastian's story; chemistry with Annabelle builds despite his misgivings
- **End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Doogan wakes up in a fog; Detective Martinez is standing over him; Annabelle is dead in the bed beside him. Cut on "Hands where I can see them."

## Success Checks (Acceptance Criteria)
- [ ] All 9 scenes from the outline are drafted in sequence
- [ ] Doogan's voice is consistent: sharp, adaptive humor; observational intelligence
- [ ] Eddie/Abby/Baxter dynamics are established through dialogue, not narration
- [ ] "The first job" backstory feels like a fond memory with an edge
- [ ] Sebastian LeClere triggers Doogan's instincts without being cartoonishly suspicious
- [ ] Doogan/Annabelle chemistry builds naturally across farmer's market and dinner scenes
- [ ] Cliffhanger lands with maximum narrative punch
- [ ] POV rule (The Fletch Rule) is maintained—no scenes where Doogan isn't present
- [ ] Dialogue carries 80–90% of scene momentum
- [ ] Tone shifts (light → dark → light) feel nimble, not jarring
- [ ] Episode reads as a complete story with a satisfying arc and strong forward hook

## Open Questions
None at this stage. All necessary materials exist in the repo. If clarification is needed during planning, those questions will be logged in `clarify.md`.

## Assumptions
- The content output folder structure will be determined during the plan stage (likely `content/episodes/` or similar)
- Scene ordering and beats from `episode-01.md` are canonical and will be followed unless a structural issue emerges during drafting
- Character voice samples from existing materials (pitch, outline dialogue snippets) are sufficient to extrapolate full scenes
- The target word count (~4,500–5,500) allows for all 9 scenes without compression that would sacrifice voice or pacing
