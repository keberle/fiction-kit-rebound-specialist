# Draft Idea (Intent Spec)

**Draft:** 004-episode-04-draft
**Created:** 2026-01-01

## Intent Summary
Create Episode 4 ("Nurse Nancy") as a complete 15-scene episode following the detailed outline established in `elements/outlines/episode-04.md`. This episode advances the murder mystery investigation through Doogan's infiltration of Nancy's life while the team uncovers the criminal organization controlling Dr. Feldman's clinic. The episode spans three days, culminating in a cliffhanger that mirrors Episode 1—Doogan drugged and framed for Nancy's murder using Woodmark Vineyards wine.

## Motivation
- Episode 4 is critical for revealing the larger conspiracy: a criminal organization using the clinic for insurance fraud and identity theft
- Nancy serves as both investigative target and tragic victim—establishing the organization's ruthlessness
- Parallel investigations (Doogan/Nancy, Team/Dr. Feldman) demonstrate team coordination under pressure
- The cliffhanger creates urgency by repeating the Episode 1 setup, showing the organization's pattern
- Doogan's sacrifice plays (clinic encounter, enduring Nancy's awfulness) demonstrate character loyalty and professional cost

## Scope
- **Affected outline/scenes/files:** 
  - Create: `content/episodes/episode-04-nurse-nancy/` directory
  - Create: 15 scene files (01-brunch-with-the-plastics.md through 15-dinner-confessions.md)
  - Reference: `elements/outlines/episode-04.md` (source outline)
  - Reference: `elements/characters/` (for consistency)
  - Reference: `elements/checklist.md`, `elements/pov.md`, `elements/tone.md`
  
- **Characters involved:** 
  - Primary: Doogan Andrews, Nancy (clinic nurse - new character), Detective Martinez
  - Supporting: Eddie Palmer, Abby Palmer, Baxter (Rodney Baxter)
  - Minor: Dr. Feldman (first appearance), Frank Charles (criminal surveillance), clinic staff, pharmacy family (elderly couple + granddaughter)
  
- **Settings involved:** 
  - Citrine & Sage Brunch Spot (trendy LA restaurant)
  - Doogan's Cougar (drive scenes)
  - Doogan's condo
  - Eddie and Abby's house/kitchen
  - The clinic (multiple scenes)
  - Traverse Park
  - Dr. Feldman's house (older Pacific Point neighborhood)
  - The pharmacy
  - Trendy LA restaurant (dinner)

## Desired Outcome
- 15 complete scenes that collectively tell Episode 4's story
- Strong character voice for Nancy (obnoxious, unethical, but not malicious—ultimately a victim)
- Clear revelation of prescription fraud, criminal organization's control, and Dr. Feldman's coercion
- High-tension comedy in clinic encounter (Scene 10: nurse uniform gambit)
- Emotional weight in final scene—Nancy's death is tragic despite her flaws
- Perfect cliffhanger callback to Episode 1 that raises stakes
- Maintains continuity with Episodes 1-3 and sets up Episode 5

## Constraints / Non‑Negotiables
- POV: Doogan limited third-person (established in `elements/pov.md`)
- Tone: Dark comedy, witty, fast-paced (per `elements/tone.md`)
- Voice: Follow `voice/style.md` strictly—no authorial commentary, no psychological interpretation
- Nancy's character: Awful but not evil—must be sympathetic in death
- Woodmark Vineyards: Critical callback detail—must be clear but not overexplained
- Martinez's recurring line: "We really should stop meeting this way, Mr. Andrews" (callback to Episode 1)
- Earpiece usage: Established in Episode 1—Doogan wears it constantly except when compromising
- Setting: All scenes follow Southern California norms (car culture, no taxis, "the" before freeways)

## Serial Beat Requirements
- **Hook (Scene 1):** Opens with garish sexual statement from the plastics' table—immediately reinvests reader in Doogan's world and establishes Nancy's character through champagne bottle swap
- **Escalation/Turn (Scene 6):** Nancy casually admits prescription fraud; (Scene 10) Clinic encounter forces Doogan's sacrifice play; (Scene 14) Dr. Feldman reveals criminal organization control
- **End‑Button / Cliffhanger (Scene 15):** Doogan sees "Woodmark Vineyards," blacks out, wakes to Martinez—Nancy dead beside him. Exact parallel to Episode 1 ending.

## Success Checks (Acceptance Criteria)
- [ ] All 15 scenes written following outline beats
- [ ] Nancy's character arc: obnoxious → reveals fraud → victim (tragic death)
- [ ] Dr. Feldman's revelation scene clearly establishes criminal organization as true antagonist
- [ ] Clinic encounter (Scene 10) balances high-stakes tension with comedy
- [ ] Woodmark Vineyards callback is clear and impactful
- [ ] Martinez's dialogue/character consistent with Episodes 1-3
- [ ] POV never breaks—Doogan's limited perspective maintained throughout
- [ ] Voice compliance: no authorial commentary, no psychological interpretation
- [ ] Three-day timeline is clear and logical
- [ ] Cliffhanger ending parallels Episode 1 effectively

## Open Questions
- None at this stage (outline is comprehensive)

## Assumptions
- Nancy character details not in outline can be inferred from established patterns (designer everything, Botox, bleached hair)
- Clinic layout can be developed as needed (exam rooms, file room, staff lounge)
- Doogan's condo details established in earlier episodes remain consistent
- Team dynamic/banter patterns established in Episodes 1-3 continue
- Martinez's investigation tactics remain consistent with prior episodes
