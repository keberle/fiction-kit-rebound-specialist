## Serial Episode Beats
- **Episode:** 04 — Nurse Nancy
  - **Hook (Scene 1):** Garish sexual statement from plastics' table + Nancy's champagne bottle swap establishes character
  - **Escalation/Turn:** 
    - Scene 6: Prescription fraud revealed
    - Scene 10: Clinic encounter/sacrifice play
    - Scene 14: Dr. Feldman reveals criminal organization
  - **End‑Button/Cliffhanger (Scene 15):** Woodmark Vineyards → blackout → Martinez → Nancy dead

## Sequence of Work
1. Review outline for each scene before writing
2. Load relevant character files for consistency
3. Write scenes in order (1-15) to maintain narrative flow
4. Brief scenes (2, 4, 11) should be 600-800 words
5. Standard scenes should be 1200-1800 words
6. Major scenes (1, 6, 10, 14, 15) should be 1800-2500 words
7. After every 3-5 scenes, verify POV/voice compliance
8. Final QA pass for continuity and checklist compliance

## Dependencies
- Existing Episodes 1-3 for character voice, Martinez patterns, Woodmark Vineyards setup
- Character files for Doogan, Eddie, Abby, Baxter (Rodney), Martinez
- POV and tone guidelines

## Open Questions
<None — proceed with implementation>

## Assumptions
- Scene length targets are flexible based on content needs
- Dialogue style established in Episodes 1-3 continues
- Nancy character can be developed within outline parameters
- Dr. Feldman and Frank Charles are new characters—develop as needed
