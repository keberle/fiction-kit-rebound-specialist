**Draft:** 002-episode-02-draft  
**Generated:** 2025-01-13  
**Updated:** 2025-12-25 (REORGANIZED for alternating timelines)  
**Status:** Ready for implementation

---

## REORGANIZATION NOTE (2025-12-25)

**Episode 2 outline and tasks have been REORGANIZED to alternate between timelines for better pacing and passage of time.**

**Key Changes:**
- New Scene 4 (Doogan's Condo) inserted between Eddie's Kitchen and Restaurant Meeting
- All subsequent scenes renumbered (+1)
- Old Scene 4 (Restaurant Meeting) → **New Scene 5**
- Old Scene 5 (Country Club) → **New Scene 6**
- Old Scene 6 (Strip Mall Clinic) → **New Scene 7**
- And so on through Scene 19 (File Deletion Cliffhanger)

**New Alternating Structure (19 Scenes):**
- Scenes 1-5: Setup (unchanged except new Scene 4)
- Scene 6: Hunt begins → Scene 7: Investigation begins
- Scene 8: Hunt continues → Scene 9: Investigation planning
- Scene 10: Hunt accelerates → Scene 11: Investigation attempts
- Scene 12: Hunt turning point → Scene 13: Investigation success
- Scene 14: Hunt victory → Scene 15: Investigation moral choice
- Scenes 16-19: Convergence (unchanged except renumbered)

This creates better pacing, stronger sense of time passage, and more dynamic storytelling throughout Act 2.
