# Draft Tasks (Actionable Work Items)

**Draft:** 002-episode-02-draft  
**Generated:** 2025-01-13  
**Updated:** 2025-12-27 (CONSOLIDATED scenes 10-13, updated to 17 scenes)  
**Status:** Ready for implementation

## REORGANIZATION NOTE (2025-12-27)

**Episode 2 outline and tasks have been CONSOLIDATED from 19 to 17 scenes.**

**Latest Changes:**
- **Scene 10:** Combined old scenes 10 & 12 into single speakeasy scene with conversation (no longer dwelling on complicated history)
- **Scene 11:** Reworked old scene 11 & 13 into successful Baxter infiltration with Abby guiding remotely; introduces Nurse Nancy briefly
- **Scenes 12-17:** Renumbered from old 14-19

**New Structure (17 Scenes):**
- Scenes 1-5: Setup
- Scene 6: Hunt begins → Scene 7: Investigation begins
- Scene 8: Hunt continues → Scene 9: Investigation planning
- Scene 10: Hunt turning point (speakeasy + conversation) → Scene 11: Investigation success (Baxter infiltration)
- Scene 12: Hunt victory → Scene 13: Investigation moral choice
- Scenes 14-17: Convergence

This creates better pacing with consolidated scenes and stronger character development in Scene 10.
