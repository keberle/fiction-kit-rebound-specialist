## Scene Order Decision (Ensemble Storytelling Analysis)

**REORGANIZED 19-scene structure to ALTERNATE between timelines for better pacing.**

**Why the new alternating structure works:**
- Scenes 1-5: Setup (Doogan POV - establish both jobs + reset at condo)
- Scene 6: Hunt begins (Doogan)
- Scene 7: Investigation begins (Eddie) — **first alternation**
- Scene 8: Hunt continues (Doogan)
- Scene 9: Investigation planning (Eddie/Baxter/Abby) — **alternation**
- Scene 10: Hunt accelerates (Doogan)
- Scene 11: Investigation attempts fail (Eddie/Baxter) — **alternation**
- Scene 12: Hunt turning point (Doogan)
- Scene 13: Investigation success (Abby) — **alternation**
- Scene 14: Hunt victory (Doogan)
- Scene 15: Investigation moral choice (Eddie/Baxter) — **alternation**
- Scenes 16-19: Convergence (both timelines interweave naturally)

**Benefits of alternating structure:**
- Creates sense of passage of time across the day
- No timeline disappears for more than 1-2 scenes
- Builds parallel tension and momentum
- More dynamic pacing throughout Act 2
- Reader gets regular updates on both problems

**Stephen King principle applied:** Every scene opens/closes doors with forward discovery momentum.

## Critical Writing Rules

### McDonald Scene Openings (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
 NEVER: Atmospheric intros, weather descriptions, introspection before dialogue  
 ALWAYS: Dialogue mid-progress, eavesdropper test

### POV (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Third-person close, one POV per scene
- Doogan: 12 scenes (1-5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18)
- Team: 7 scenes (7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)

### Character Voice
- **Eddie:** Motor-mouth avalanche, mid-sentence starts, tangents circle back
- **Doogan:** Measured drawl, short responses, dry
- **Abby:** Elevated, sharp, pragmatic (NO yoga pants/messy home)
- **Martinez:** Deadpan, dry wit, principled

### Cheryl Throughline (Scenes 6, 8, 10, 12, 14)
- Sharp "younger sister/wedding" comments (edge, not jokes)
- Competitive drive masking pain
- Scene 16 reveal must feel inevitable

### Clue Mechanics (MUST BE INTERACTIVE)
- Scene 8: "Red and white"  clerk gives envelope
- Scene 12: Decline champagne (Atticus didn't drink)  water with golden ticket
- Scene 14: "Quid agis?"  answer "Not until the fat lady sings"

### Stephen King Principles
- Every scene opens/closes doors
- Discovery-driven (no plot convenience)
- Sensory detail + emotional truth
- Cut 10-20% in rewrite
