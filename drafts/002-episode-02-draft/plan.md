## Scene Order Decision (Ensemble Storytelling Analysis)

**CONSOLIDATED 17-scene structure with alternating timelines for better pacing.**

**Why the new consolidated structure works:**
- Scenes 1-5: Setup (Doogan POV - establish both jobs + reset at condo)
- Scene 6: Hunt begins (Doogan)
- Scene 7: Investigation begins (Eddie) — **first alternation**
- Scene 8: Hunt continues (Doogan)
- Scene 9: Investigation planning (Eddie/Baxter/Abby) — **alternation**
- Scene 10: Hunt turning point + conversation (Doogan) — **CONSOLIDATED: combines speakeasy reveal with character development**
- Scene 11: Investigation success (Eddie/Baxter/Abby) — **CONSOLIDATED: Baxter infiltration with Abby guiding, Nurse Nancy foreshadowed**
- Scene 12: Hunt victory (Doogan)
- Scene 13: Investigation moral choice (Eddie/Baxter) — **alternation**
- Scenes 14-17: Convergence (both timelines interweave naturally)

**Benefits of consolidated structure:**
- Scene 10 builds character connection without dwelling on complicated history
- Scene 11 delivers successful infiltration with team dynamics and future setup
- Faster pacing by removing redundant beat
- More dynamic character moments
- Better sense of passage of time across the day
- No timeline disappears for more than 1-2 scenes

**Stephen King principle applied:** Every scene opens/closes doors with forward discovery momentum.

## 17 Scene Files (Full Implementation Guide)

See elements/outlines/episode-02.md for complete beats. Key requirements below.

- Scene 2: Lawyer walkout (opens: legal constraints, lawyer costs; note: police confiscated Doogan's earpiece during booking)
- Scene 3: Eddie's kitchen (opens: new job to fund defense; CRITICAL: Eddie FaceTime call with Baxter in kitchen about earpiece replacement—Baxter has backup, will deliver to Doogan's condo)
- Scene 4: Doogan's condo (opens: Doogan alone, processing; Baxter delivers earpiece; cover story for confiscated device established)
- Scene 5: Restaurant meeting (opens: wedding job parameters)

### Scene 6: Hunt Begins (Doogan POV)

### Scenes 14-17: Convergence
- Scene 14: Rehearsal dinner (Doogan POV—Cheryl reveal: dumped Brad, sister swooped)
- Scene 15: One-way street trap (Doogan POV—followed after dinner, Baxter's trap, Martinez revealed)

## Critical Writing Rules

### McDonald Scene Openings (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
✅ NEVER: Atmospheric intros, weather descriptions, introspection before dialogue  
✅ ALWAYS: Dialogue mid-progress, eavesdropper test

### POV (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Third-person close, one POV per scene
- Doogan: 10 scenes (1-5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)
- Team: 7 scenes (7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17)

### Character Voice
- **Eddie:** Motor-mouth avalanche, mid-sentence starts, tangents circle back
- **Doogan:** Measured drawl, short responses, dry
- **Abby:** Elevated, sharp, pragmatic (NO yoga pants/messy home)
- **Martinez:** Deadpan, dry wit, principled

### Cheryl Throughline (Scenes 6, 8, 10, 12)
- Sharp "younger sister/wedding" comments (edge, not jokes)
- Competitive drive masking pain
- Scene 14 reveal must feel inevitable

### Clue Mechanics (MUST BE INTERACTIVE)
- Scene 8: "Red and white" → clerk gives envelope
- Scene 10: Decline champagne (Atticus didn't drink) → water with golden ticket
- Scene 12: "Quid agis?" → answer "Not until the fat lady sings"

### Stephen King Principles
- Every scene opens/closes doors
- Discovery-driven (no plot convenience)
- Sensory detail + emotional truth
- Cut 10-20% in rewrite
