### 2025-12-26 — Scene 1 Rewrite Analysis

**Rewrite Completed:** Episode 2, Scene 1 (Holding Cell Graffiti)

**Changes Made:**
- **Opening:** Changed from flat declarative ("The holding cell had no furniture") to McDonald-style opening with Doogan already in holding cell, observing graffiti
- **Atmosphere:** Strengthened sensory grounding (industrial cleaner smell, fluorescent buzz, cold metal)
- **Character Voices:** Sharpened Martinez's dry delivery, Finch's menacing presence, Doogan's gallows humor
- **Pacing:** Added breathing room, escalated tension through interrogation
- **Structure:** Maintained holding cell → interview room transition per police procedure

**Craft Improvements:**
- McDonald opening rule enforced
- POV maintained (tight third-person close)
- Character voices differentiated effectively
- Sensory detail increased
- Pacing improved with silence and beats
- Button ending strengthened

**Continuity:** No new canonical details added. All character behavior consistent with established files.

**Element Files Updated:** None required

**Impact:** Scene 1 now serves as stronger cold open, establishes Martinez/Finch dynamic better
