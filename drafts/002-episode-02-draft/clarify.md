## Answers (recorded)

1. **Q:** Should there be a brief scene inside the police interrogation room before the holding cell, or do we enter with Doogan already in the cell?
   **A:** The scene opens in the holding cell. The reader can guess at the events leading to that.

2. **Q:** How much time has passed between Episode 1's ending (Doogan waking next to dead Annabelle) and the holding cell cold open?
   **A:** The timeline between events is probably only a couple of hours—the time it would take for Doogan to make his one phone call to Eddie and for Eddie to find some lawyer willing to take the case.

3. **Q:** For the scavenger hunt clues, should Baxter's earpiece commentary be shown as direct dialogue or indicated through Doogan's reactions?
   **A:** Yes, show Baxter's dialogue mixed in but occasionally remind the reader that he's not in the scene but in Doogan's ear. Vary that description so it doesn't get repetitive.

4. **Q:** What is the rehearsal dinner venue—hotel, restaurant, or the Billings' home?
   **A:** The rehearsal dinner is at a trendy restaurant overlooking the coast, which is why Cheryl ends up hinting that she could use a ride to the dinner if Doogan was up for it. The restaurant has that kind of Malibu old money vibe that exists in Southern California. (Note: Research online to fill in any other details needed for this element.)

5. **Q:** The outline mentions Jillian and "her worthless boyfriend"—do they need names or can the boyfriend stay unnamed?
   **A:** No. Cheryl wouldn't know his name anyway. She barely cares about Jillian well enough to know her name, so there's no way she'd bother to learn his. Doogan can maybe ask, but Cheryl should be pretty dismissive that he's not important enough for name recognition.

## Decisions / Locked Choices
- Cold open starts in holding cell (no interrogation room scene beforehand)
- Timeline: ~2 hours between Episode 1 ending and cold open
- Baxter's earpiece dialogue: shown as direct dialogue with varied reminders he's remote
- Rehearsal dinner: trendy coastal restaurant with Malibu old money vibe
- Jillian's boyfriend: remains unnamed; Cheryl doesn't know/care about his name

## Remaining Unknowns
- None (all critical questions answered)
