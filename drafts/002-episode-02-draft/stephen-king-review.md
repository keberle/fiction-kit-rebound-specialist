## Core Principle: Discovery-Driven Storytelling

**Stephen King:** "Stories are fossils you uncover, not machines you engineer."

**Episode 2 Application:**
✅ **Hunt sequence** (Scenes 7-10): Doogan discovers Cheryl's pain through her "younger sister" comments and competitive edge—not told directly  
✅ **Investigation thread** (Scenes 11-14): Team discovers clinic connection through real detective work (tax records, physical infiltration)—not plot convenience  
✅ **Cheryl reveal** (Scene 15): Sister/ex-boyfriend truth emerges naturally in conversation—feels inevitable, not surprising  
✅ **File deletion** (Scene 18): Discovery happens in real time—villain's presence revealed through action, not exposition

**Verdict:** Episode follows discovery-driven approach. Characters learn through observation and investigation, not convenient exposition.

## Every Scene Must Open/Close Doors

**Stephen King:** "Each scene should change something. Open a door and close another."

## Momentum & Pacing Analysis

**Stephen King:** "Cut 10-20% in rewrite. Adverbs are not your friend."

### Current Structure Pacing:

**Act 1 (Scenes 1-6):** Setup and parallel track establishment  
- 6 scenes to establish both tracks
- **Assessment:** Tight. Each scene necessary. No fat to cut.

**Act 2 (Scenes 7-14):** Hunt + Investigation escalation  
- 8 scenes split between tracks
- Hunt: 4 consecutive scenes (7-10) build Cheryl arc uninterrupted
- Investigation: 4 consecutive scenes (11-14) escalate systematically
- **Assessment:** Block structure serves story. Cutting between tracks more frequently would break momentum of both arcs.

**Act 3 (Scenes 15-18):** Convergence and cliffhanger  
- 4 scenes for payoff
- **Assessment:** Economical. Every beat necessary.

**Scene Count:** 18 scenes for ~18,000-20,000 words = ~1,000-1,100 words/scene average  
**Verdict:** ✅ Lean structure. No scenes to cut. Apply 10-20% cut rule at sentence/paragraph level during drafting, not structure level.

## Character Truth Over Plot Convenience

**Stephen King:** "Characters must behave honestly, not conveniently for your plot."

### Character Honesty Audit:

**Doogan:**
- ✅ Uses work to avoid processing trauma (Scene 3) — honest defense mechanism
- ✅ Stays on grocery-store story under interrogation (Scene 1) — consistent with self-preservation
- ✅ Notices Cheryl's pain but doesn't press (Scenes 5-10) — professional restraint, not nosiness
- ✅ Loses Cheryl connection due to Martinez surveillance (Scene 15) — consequence of being murder suspect, not forced

**Eddie:**
- ✅ Pushes Doogan back to work immediately (Scene 3) — pragmatic urgency, not insensitivity (lawyer costs money)
- ✅ Gets caught staking out clinic (Scene 6) — amateur mistake, honest for character
- ✅ Willing to break law for Doogan (Scene 14) — loyalty overrides caution, consistent with established character

**Baxter:**
- ✅ Resists illegal access (Scene 14) — fears Doogan's disapproval, honest tension
- ✅ Fails at physical infiltration (Scene 12) — stereotypical nerd can't fake social competence, honest

**Abby:**
- ✅ Succeeds through social intelligence (Scene 13) — plays to her strengths, not plot magic
- ✅ Pragmatic solution to tech problem (Scene 11) — competence, not heroics

**Cheryl:**
- ✅ Competitive drive masking pain (Scenes 5-10) — consistent emotional throughline
- ✅ Reveal at dinner feels inevitable (Scene 15) — seeds planted in earlier "younger sister" comments

**Martinez:**
- ✅ Warns team off investigation (Scene 16) — principled cop doing job, not villain
- ✅ Admits things don't add up but can't clear Doogan — honest about limitations

**Verdict:** All character behavior driven by established traits and honest reactions, not plot needs.

## Sensory Detail & Emotional Truth

**Stephen King:** "Ground your scenes in physical experience. Readers need to feel what characters feel."

### Required Sensory Details (Per Outline):

**Scene 1:** Cold metal bench, industrial cleaner smell, bone-tired exhaustion ✅  
**Scene 3:** Doogan barely tastes pancakes (trauma processing) ✅  
**Scene 5:** Running on fumes, physical tells of exhaustion ✅  
**Scenes 7-10:** Sweat, physical comedy, competition ✅  
**Scenes 6, 11-14:** Tension, frustration, boredom of stakeout/infiltration ✅  

**Emotional Truth Check:**
- Doogan's exhaustion carries through Scenes 1-5 (interrogation → work same day)
- Cheryl's pain masked by competition (throughline Scenes 5-15)
- Eddie's desperation (Doogan can't go to prison) drives moral compromise
- Team investigation frustration (Scenes 11-14) builds to Abby's effortless success

**Verdict:** Sensory requirements documented in outline. Emotional throughlines consistent. Implementation will ground scenes in physical experience.

## Fair-Play Mystery Structure

**Stephen King:** "Don't cheat your reader. They should have the same information as your protagonist."

### Information Flow Audit:

**POV System:**
- Third-person close, one POV per scene
- Reader learns when POV character learns
- No villain POV, no omniscient reveals

**Clues Available to Reader:**
- Scene 6: Clinic is Annabelle's real employer (Eddie learns, reader learns)
- Scene 13: Abby gets software name (reader sees it happen)
- Scene 18: File deletion in real time (Baxter and reader see together)
- Cheryl reveal (Scene 15): Seeds planted in "younger sister" comments (Scenes 5-10)

**No Cheating:**
- ✅ No information withheld from reader that POV character knows
- ✅ No convenient discoveries off-page
- ✅ No villain reveals reader couldn't have deduced

**Verdict:** Fair-play structure maintained. Ensemble POV allows reader to track both hunt and investigation without omniscience.

## Ensemble Storytelling Structure

**Research Finding:** "Ensemble casts emphasize interconnectivity through location, event, or overarching theme. Parallel plots create cognitive mapping for audience."

### Episode 2 Ensemble Analysis:

**Interconnectivity:**
- **Location:** Both tracks tied to Pacific Point/San Diego area
- **Event:** Annabelle's murder connects both tracks
- **Theme:** Secrets and hidden truths (Cheryl's sister, Annabelle's discovery, file deletion)

**Parallel Plots:**
- **Hunt Track:** Doogan solving scavenger hunt while building connection with Cheryl
- **Investigation Track:** Team solving Annabelle's employment mystery
- **Convergence:** Scene 15 (Martinez surveillance connects both), Scene 18 (file deletion escalates stakes for both)

**Cognitive Mapping:**
- Scene 6 cut establishes parallel tracking early
- Neither track disappears for more than 4 scenes
- Reader can track both without confusion
- Both serve overarching mystery (Who killed Annabelle and why?)

**Verdict:** Optimal ensemble structure. Current scene order (no reordering needed) maintains rhythm without sacrificing clarity.

## Dialogue-First Technique (McDonald Style)

**Voice/Style Requirement:** "McDonald dialogue-first technique + eavesdropper test"

### Eavesdropper Test Application:

Every scene must open with:
- Dialogue already in progress (mid-sentence if Eddie)
- Character mid-action
- Reader feels they arrived late to conversation

❌ **Forbidden:**
- Atmospheric descriptions ("The kitchen smelled of...")
- Weather or time-of-day setup
- Character introspection before dialogue
- "Establishing shot" descriptions

✅ **Required:**
- McDonald-style cold opens
- Dialogue tags max every 3 lines
- 80-90% dialogue-driven

**Verdict:** Dialogue-first requirement documented in plan.md for every scene. Implementation must comply.

---

## Serial Fiction Structure

**Voice/Format Requirement:** Hook → escalation/turn → end-button/cliffhanger

**Episode 2 Structure:**

**Hook (Scene 1):** Holding cell graffiti + Martinez/Finch interrogation  
- Immediate tension, absurdist humor, murder stakes

**Escalation/Turn (Scenes 2-17):** Dual-track escalation  
- Hunt: Competition → connection → reveal → loss (Martinez surveillance)
- Investigation: Stakeout → infiltration failures → success → moral compromise

**End-Button/Cliffhanger (Scene 18):** File deletion in real time  
- Someone actively covering tracks NOW
- Raises stakes for Episode 3
- Shifts from "whodunit" to "who's covering it up"

**Verdict:** Serial structure adhered to. Episode ends on active threat (not passive recap). Forward momentum into Episode 3.

## Final Verdict: APPROVED FOR TASK GENERATION

### Strengths:
✅ Discovery-driven storytelling (characters learn honestly, not through plot convenience)  
✅ Every scene opens/closes doors (no static scenes)  
✅ Lean 18-scene structure (no fat to cut at structural level)  
✅ Character behavior honest and consistent  
✅ Sensory details and emotional truth documented  
✅ Fair-play mystery structure (ensemble POV without cheating)  
✅ Optimal ensemble rhythm (Scene 6 interweaving, block structure serves arcs)  
✅ Dialogue-first technique required for all scenes  
✅ Serial fiction structure (hook → escalation → cliffhanger)  

### Implementation Notes:
- Apply 10-20% cut rule at **sentence/paragraph level** during drafting (not scene level)
- Verify McDonald-style openings for every scene (no atmospheric intros)
- Ground scenes in physical experience (exhaustion, sweat, tension)
- Maintain character voice consistency (Eddie motor-mouth, Doogan measured, etc.)
- Preserve Cheryl throughline across Scenes 5-15 (seeds → reveal)

**Current 18-scene order requires NO structural changes. Ready for tasks.md generation.**

## Stephen King Principles Summary (Implementation Checklist)

For each scene during drafting:

1. **Does this scene open a door and close another?** (Change something)
2. **Is the character behavior honest?** (Not plot-convenient)
3. **Is there sensory detail?** (Ground in physical experience)
4. **Is there emotional truth?** (Readers feel what characters feel)
5. **Does it open with dialogue or action?** (No atmospheric setup)
6. **Can I cut 10-20% at paragraph level?** (Tighten, eliminate redundancy)
7. **Are adverbs necessary?** (Prefer strong verbs)
8. **Does discovery feel earned?** (Not convenient)

**This checklist should be applied during QA pass after all scenes drafted.**
