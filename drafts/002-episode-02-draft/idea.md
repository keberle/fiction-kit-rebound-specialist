# Draft Idea (Intent Spec)

**Draft:** 002-episode-02-draft
**Created:** 2024-12-24

## Intent Summary
Draft Episode 2 ("The Wedding Weekend"), continuing the story from Episode 1 where Doogan woke up next to the murdered Annabelle Anders. This episode runs two tracks at once under the **ensemble third-person-close** rules: Doogan navigates a police interrogation and then immediately takes a new rebound job (keeping maid-of-honor Cheryl from sabotaging her sister's wedding), while the Annabelle/clinic investigation progresses through **on-page team scenes** (Eddie/Abby/Baxter) that intercut naturally with Doogan’s wedding weekend obstacle course. The episode balances procedural comedy (country club scavenger hunt) with the darkening mystery thread (clinic records being deleted in real time).

## Motivation
- **Murder stakes:** Doogan is now a murder suspect. The breezy rebound-comedy tone must absorb real danger without losing its wit.
- **Character introductions:** Martinez and Finch need proper establishment as antagonists/foils. The outline notes Martinez is dry and deadpan—distinct from Doogan's charm—and Finch is the cynical veteran cop.
- **Investigation thread:** Eddie, Abby, and Baxter must begin the parallel investigation that will carry across multiple episodes. Their chemistry and competence need to shine.
- **POV integrity under concurrency:** Episode 2 has multiple events happening at once; the mechanism must stay McDonald-ish (tight third-person close) while allowing the team to carry scenes away from Doogan without head-hopping.
- **New job stakes:** The Cheryl/wedding job is comedic but emotional—she's the older sister who dumped Brad, and now her younger sister is marrying him. The real job is containment, not distraction.
- **Cliffhanger setup:** The episode ends with Baxter watching a clinic file delete itself in real time—someone else is covering tracks.

## Scope
- **Outline:** `elements/outlines/episode-02.md` (18 scenes — **revised: consolidated scavenger hunt sequence**)
- **Characters involved:****
  - Doogan Andrews (protagonist, POV)
  - Eddie Palmer (manager, investigation lead)
  - Abby Palmer (pragmatic operator)
  - Rodney Baxter (tech support, hacking)
  - Detective Paul Martinez (primary homicide investigator)
  - Detective Peter Finch (Martinez's partner, cynical)
  - Hank Stillman (low-end defense attorney)
  - Thomas Billings (wealthy client, "Thomas not Tom")
  - Sylvia Billings (trophy wife, wedding designer)
  - Cheryl Billings (target, maid of honor, older sister)
  - Terry Tamborino (wedding planner, flamboyant)
  - Jillian (rival bridesmaid) + worthless boyfriend
- **Settings:**
  - Holding cell (cold open)
  - Police station hallway
  - Eddie's kitchen
  - Restaurant in Pacific Point (client meeting)
  - Country club (scavenger hunt kickoff)
  - Strip mall clinic exterior
  - Various scavenger hunt stops (flower shop, pub, used bookstore, speakeasy)
  - Clinic interior (Abby infiltration)
  - Rehearsal dinner venue
  - Wedding reception venue
  - Eddie/Abby's living room (final scene)
- **Files affected:**
  - New: `content/episodes/episode-02-the-wedding-weekend/` (directory + scene files)
  - Possible updates: `elements/characters.md` (if new character details emerge)

## Desired Outcome
- **18 scenes** drafted following the outline beats precisely.
- **McDonald-style POV (ensemble-ready):** Third-person close with **one POV per scene**. Default Doogan, but scenes may anchor to Eddie/Abby/Baxter when they’re doing investigation work away from Doogan. No head hopping within a scene.
- **Tone:** Fast, witty, slightly dark—gallows humor in the holding cell, satirical edge during the scavenger hunt, tension in the clinic investigation.
- **Martinez characterization:** Establish him as Doogan's deadpan foil—principled, dry wit, not flashy but smart.
- **Scavenger hunt:** Literature-coded clues (Shakespeare, To Kill a Mockingbird, Pride and Prejudice, Gatsby, Harry Potter) solved through Baxter's earpiece assist.
- **Investigation thread:** Eddie/Abby/Baxter's parallel work builds toward the cliffhanger—clinic software name acquired, Baxter hacks in, file deletes itself.
- **Cliffhanger:** Episode ends with Baxter, Eddie, and Abby watching Annabelle's flagged file vanish. Someone else is logged in. Active cover-up.

## Constraints / Non-Negotiables
- **POV:** Third-person close. Never first-person. Never villain POV. One POV per scene.
- **Fair-play information:** No omniscient cutaways or antagonist-only reveals. If the POV character isn’t present, it’s off-screen and must arrive as reported action (calls/texts/briefings/documents).
- **Secrecy Rule:** Cheryl must never learn she was hired to be rebounded.
- **Checklist compliance:** All scenes must pass the Pre-Writing Verification Checklist in `elements/checklist.md`.
- **Eddie's voice:** Motor-mouth style—steamrolls, tangents, em-dashes.
- **Abby's voice:** Elevated, sharp, pragmatic.
- **Martinez's voice:** Deadpan, measured, unsentimental.

## Serial Beat Requirements (if applicable)
- **Hook (Cold Open):** Doogan sitting in holding cell reading wall graffiti while Martinez and Finch lean on him—absurd, dry, tense.
- **Escalation/Turn:** Rehearsal dinner reveal (Cheryl dumped Brad, Gabby swooped in) + Martinez surveillance ambush (cops are following Eddie/Baxter/Abby too).
- **End-Button / Cliffhanger:** Baxter opens Annabelle's flagged file → it vanishes in real time → someone else is logged in deleting records.

## Success Checks (Acceptance Criteria)
- [ ] 18 scenes drafted matching outline beats (**revised: consolidated hunt sequence**)
- [ ] McDonald-style dialogue-first openings (no atmospheric intros)
- [ ] POV never breaks (no first-person, no villain POV, no head hopping)
- [ ] Sensory detail present (Scene 1: cold/smell/exhaustion; Scenes 7/9/11/12: sweat/competition; etc.)
- [ ] Cheryl's emotional throughline shows in Scenes 5, 7, 9, 11, 12 (wounded pride, sister comments)
- [ ] Scene 15 reveal feels inevitable, not surprising
- [ ] Martinez/Finch properly characterized in interrogation scene
- [ ] Martinez surveillance timing (Scene 15) costs Doogan the Cheryl connection
- [ ] Scavenger hunt clues have specific mechanics (clerk interactions detailed)
- [ ] Eddie's motor-mouth voice present in Scenes 2, 3, 4, 14 (avalanche style, not crisp)
- [ ] Abby's clinic infiltration (Scene 13) shows her pragmatic competence
- [ ] Doogan's emotional state shown through physical tells (exhaustion, barely tasting food, using work as distraction)
- [ ] Cliffhanger delivers—file deletion is visually/narratively clear
- [ ] All character details verified against element files
- [ ] Continuity with Episode 1 maintained (Annabelle murder, team setup)

## Open Questions
- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a brief scene inside the police interrogation room before the holding cell, or do we enter with Doogan already in the cell?
- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How much time has passed between Episode 1's ending (Doogan waking next to dead Annabelle) and the holding cell cold open?
- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The outline mentions Jillian and "her worthless boyfriend"—do they need names or can the boyfriend stay unnamed?

## Assumptions
- Holding cell cold open assumes Doogan has already been processed and is waiting for interrogation—no dramatization of arrest itself.
- Time gap between episodes is short (same night or next morning).
- Jillian's boyfriend can remain unnamed (referred to as "her boyfriend" or similar).

## Clarifications
### 2024-12-24

**Q1:** Should Scene 1 open with Doogan already in the holding cell reading graffiti (starting the episode mid-situation), or should we briefly show the interrogation room first before cutting to him waiting in the cell?

**A1:** The scene opens in the holding cell. The reader can guess at the events leading to that.

**Q2:** How much time has passed between Episode 1's ending (Doogan waking up next to dead Annabelle) and the holding cell cold open? Same night? Next morning? This affects whether Doogan has slept, showered, processed the shock, etc.

**A2:** The timeline between events is probably only a couple of hours—the time it would take for Doogan to make his one phone call to Eddie and for Eddie to find some lawyer willing to take the case.

**Q3:** During the scavenger hunt, should Baxter's voice in Doogan's earpiece be shown as direct dialogue with quotation marks, or indicated through Doogan's reactions and paraphrasing?

**A3:** Yes, show Baxter's dialogue mixed in but occasionally remind the reader that he's not in the scene but in Doogan's ear. Vary that description so it doesn't get repetitive.

**Q4:** Are the rehearsal dinner and reception at a hotel, restaurant, country club, or the Billings' home? This affects scene staging and atmosphere.

**A4:** The rehearsal dinner is at a trendy restaurant overlooking the coast, which is why Cheryl ends up hinting that she could use a ride to the dinner if Doogan was up for it. The restaurant has that kind of Malibu old money vibe that exists in Southern California. (Note: Research online to fill in any other details needed for this element.)

**Q5:** Should Jillian's boyfriend get a name (even a throwaway one), or remain unnamed throughout as "her boyfriend" or "the boyfriend"?

**A5:** No. Cheryl wouldn't know his name anyway. She barely cares about Jillian well enough to know her name, so there's no way she'd bother to learn his. Doogan can maybe ask, but Cheryl should be pretty dismissive that he's not important enough for name recognition.

### 2025-12-24

**Q6:** Can Episode 2 include full team scenes away from Doogan (Eddie/Abby/Baxter) rather than forcing investigation beats through Doogan-perceived updates?

**A6:** Yes. Use ensemble third-person close: one POV per scene (Doogan by default, but team POV is allowed). Keep it fair-play (no villain POV, no omniscient reveals).
