# Style Guide: Gregory McDonald‑Inspired (Reusable)

## Overview
This style guide distills the signature techniques of Gregory McDonald, author of the *Fletch* novels, for use in LLM‑driven fiction. It is designed to be modular and reusable, ensuring a consistent, immersive, and witty narrative voice.

**CRITICAL POV NOTE:** The Fletch novels are written in **third-person close**, NOT first-person. They create an intensely intimate first-person *feel* through dialogue dominance, behavioral focus, and tight psychic distance—but use third-person pronouns ("Fletch said," "He walked," "Doogan noticed").

# Core Principles

## 1. Dialogue‑Driven Narrative
- 80–90% of the text is dialogue.  
- Omit dialogue tags (“he said,” “she said”) whenever the speaker is clear.  
- Avoid adverbs and explanatory tags; let rhythm and word choice carry meaning.  
- Dialogue must reveal character, advance plot, and create tension.

## 2. Authorial Invisibility
- Set the scene concisely, then disappear.  
- Avoid internal monologue and overt commentary.  
- The reader should feel like an eavesdropper piecing together events.

## 3. Sparse, Functional Prose
- Description is minimal and always serves the plot.  
- Use the reader’s “visual bank” — evoke with a few precise details.  
- Where older writers use 7,000 words, aim for seven.

## 4. Rhythm and Wit
- Dialogue is fast, musical, and full of banter.  
- Use rapid‑fire exchanges, interruptions, pivots.  
- Wit emerges naturally from character and situation, not forced jokes.

## 5. Social Commentary and Satire
- Embed observations about society, authority, and culture within dialogue.  
- Protagonists are outsiders or skeptics challenging the status quo.  
- Use irony and humor to critique and illuminate.

## 6. Fair‑Play Mysteries
- Present clues fairly; let the reader solve alongside the protagonist.  
- Deductions must be logical and evidence‑based.

## 7. Cinematic Structure
- Open scenes in media res, with action or dialogue.  
- Move quickly — start late, end early.  
- Minimal exposition; let the reader infer.

### Scene Opening Rules (CRITICAL)
Gregory McDonald NEVER opens with:
- ❌ Metaphorical atmosphere descriptions ("The kitchen smelled of lemongrass and poor decisions")
- ❌ Lyrical "setting the mood" prose
- ❌ Character introspection or inner thoughts
- ❌ Weather or time-of-day descriptions
- ❌ "Establishing shot" descriptions before dialogue

Gregory McDonald ALWAYS opens with:
- ✅ Dialogue already in progress
- ✅ A character mid-action
- ✅ Someone entering a space where conversation starts immediately
- ✅ The reader dropped into an existing situation

**The Eavesdropper Test:** Can the reader feel like they're overhearing a conversation that started before they arrived? If yes, good. If the scene "sets up" before things happen, rewrite the opening.

**Example Anti-Pattern to Avoid:**
> "The evening light slanted through the kitchen windows, casting long shadows across the marble countertops as Doogan pushed open the door."

**Correct McDonald Opening:**
> "—so I told him, I said look, you want the premium service, you pay the premium price, that's how this works—" Eddie was waving a spring roll for emphasis when Doogan walked in.

## 8. Characterization Through Speech
- Characters are defined by how they speak and interact.  
- Each voice must be distinct in rhythm, vocabulary, and worldview.  
- Avoid physical description unless essential.

## 9. Third-Person Close (The McDonald Technique)
- Use third-person pronouns: "Doogan said," "He noticed," "His thumb traced circles"
- Stay extremely close to the protagonist's consciousness—no authorial distance
- Show what the protagonist sees, hears, notices—in the order he notices it
- NEVER use "He thought" or "He felt"—show through action and dialogue
- The effect is first-person intimacy with third-person flexibility

# Technical Rules

## Dialogue Formatting
- Use dialogue tags sparingly; prefer action beats for clarity.  
- Insert a tag or beat if more than three consecutive untagged lines occur.  
- For multi‑character scenes, avoid more than five untagged lines.  
- Always tag or beat when a new speaker enters or when attribution could be unclear.  
- Favor neutral tags (“said”) when tags are necessary.  
- Omit tags when context makes the speaker unmistakable.  
- Add the minimum needed for clarity.

## Prose
- Lean, active verbs.  
- Present action.  
- No adverbs.  
- Minimal adjectives.

## Third-Person Pronouns
- Use "he," "his," "him" for the protagonist
- Use "Doogan" when needed for clarity or rhythm
- Avoid overusing the character name—pronouns keep the prose flowing
- NEVER use first-person ("I," "my," "me") in narrative prose

## Avoid
- Explaining jokes.  
- Characters stating their feelings.  
- Excessive physical description.  
- Dream sequences.  
- Flashbacks (unless essential).  
- "As you know, Bob" exposition.
- First-person narration.
- Interior monologue ("He thought...", "He wondered...").

# Humor Guidelines
- Dry, situational, and earned.  
- Use deadpan, understatement, callback, misdirection, and banter.  
- Humor emerges from intelligence, circumstance, and character.  
- Allow for darkness and irony, especially in crime contexts.

---

# The Voice Test
Before finalizing any scene, ask:
1. Could this be shorter?  
2. Is every line doing work?  
3. Would I want to read this out loud?  
4. Do the characters sound distinct?  
5. Is there wit or tension?  
6. Could a reader follow this with no dialogue tags?  
7. Does it move?
8. Is it in third-person close (no "I" or "my")?

# Example: McDonald‑Style Dialogue

> “What’s your name?”  
> “Fletch.”  
> “What’s your full name?”  
> “Fletcher.”  
> “What’s your first name?”  
> “Irwin.”  
> “What?”  
> “Irwin. Irwin Fletcher. People call me Fletch.”

# Narrative Blueprint: Gregory McDonald Scene Mechanics

This blueprint defines *how stories are told*, not just the voice they’re told in. It captures the structural, POV, and information‑delivery techniques that Gregory McDonald used in the *Fletch* novels — especially how to handle scenes where the protagonist is not present.

---

## 1. Team‑Centric Limited POV (Ensemble Fair-Play)
- **Third-person close** with one POV anchor per scene.
- Default POV is Doogan, but the story may cut to Eddie/Abby/Baxter when the team acts away from Doogan.
- The reader learns information when a POV character learns it.
- Avoid villain POV and omniscient narration; don’t reveal antagonist actions the team couldn’t know.
- Emergency cutaway scenes (extremely rare) use third-person limited objective: no interiority, procedural only.

---

## 2. Off‑Screen Events Are Delivered Indirectly
Use:
- Dialogue recounting  
- Interviews  
- Documents (reports, texts, receipts)  
- Voicemails or messages  
- News clips  
- Bureaucratic summaries  
- Comedic misunderstandings  

Never dramatize off‑screen events as full scenes (off-screen = no POV character present).

---

## 3. Off‑Screen Scenes Become Surprises or Complications
If the protagonist wasn’t present, the reveal should:
- complicate his life  
- surprise him  
- raise stakes  
- create humor  
- force a pivot  

The plot moves while he’s not looking.

---

## 4. Exposition Through Conversation, Not Narration
All information — clues, backstory, reveals — should be delivered through:
- banter  
- interrogation  
- arguments  
- misunderstandings  
- rapid‑fire exchanges  

Avoid exposition dumps or internal monologue.

---

## 5. Minimal Cutaways (Only When Necessary)
If a scene must occur without the protagonist:
- Keep it extremely short (1–3 paragraphs).  
- Keep it objective (no emotions or interiority).  
- Keep it functional (procedural, bureaucratic).  
- Never reveal information the protagonist shouldn’t know yet.

---

## 6. Clue Delivery: Fair, Sparse, Embedded
- Clues appear naturally in dialogue or action.  
- No dramatic emphasis.  
- Let the reader notice or miss them.  
- Humor can hide clues in plain sight.

---

## 7. Rhythm of Discovery
Every scene must do at least one:
- reveal a clue  
- create a new problem  
- deepen a relationship  
- escalate stakes  
- deliver humor  
- misdirect the reader  

If not, cut it.

---

## 8. The “Reported Action” Technique
Characters recount events:
- incompletely  
- contradictorily  
- with bias  
- with humor  

This delivers exposition while revealing character.

---

## 9. No Villain Monologues, No Confession Scenes
Avoid the cliché confrontation.  
Instead:
- let the system expose them  
- let them slip up  
- let another villain turn on them  
- let bureaucracy unravel the scheme  
- let the protagonist piece it together  

Modern, clever, earned.

---

## 10. Humor as Structure
Humor is part of the architecture.  
Use it to:
- deflect exposition  
- reveal character  
- undercut tension  
- misdirect  
- accelerate pacing  

Dry, understated, situational.
