# Style Guide: Gregory McDonald-Inspired

## Core Principles

### 1. Dialogue-Driven Narrative
- **80-90% dialogue** — Text is mostly spoken words
- **Minimal tags** — Omit "he said" when speaker is clear
- **No adverbs** — Let rhythm carry meaning

### 2. Authorial Invisibility
- Set scene concisely, then disappear
- No internal monologue or commentary
- Reader is eavesdropper piecing things together

### 3. Sparse Prose
- Description minimal, always serves plot
- Use reader's visual bank—evoke with few details
- Where others use 7,000 words, aim for seven

### 4. Rhythm and Wit
- Fast, musical dialogue with banter
- Rapid-fire exchanges, interruptions, pivots
- Wit emerges from character, never forced

## Scene Opening Rules (CRITICAL)

**NEVER open with:**
- ❌ Atmospheric descriptions ("The kitchen smelled of...")
- ❌ Weather or time-of-day descriptions
- ❌ Character introspection
- ❌ "Establishing shot" prose

**ALWAYS open with:**
- ✅ Dialogue already in progress
- ✅ Character mid-action
- ✅ Conversation the reader walks into

**Eavesdropper Test:** Can reader feel they're overhearing a conversation that started before they arrived?

## Third-Person Close POV

- Use "he," "his," "him" for protagonist
- Stay extremely close to protagonist's consciousness
- **NEVER** use "He thought" or "He felt"—show through action
- No first-person ("I," "my") in narrative

### The "First-Person Feel" Techniques
- Dialogue dominates (80-90%)
- Behavior over interiority
- Only what POV character notices, in order noticed
- No explanations—jokes, subtext not spelled out

---

## Technical Rules

### Dialogue Tags & Beats
- Tags sparingly; prefer action beats for clarity
- Insert tag/beat if 3+ consecutive untagged lines
- Multi-character: avoid 5+ untagged lines
- Favor neutral "said" when tags needed

### Prose
- Lean, active verbs
- Present action
- No adverbs
- Minimal adjectives

### Avoid
- Explaining jokes
- Characters stating feelings
- Excessive physical description
- Dream sequences, flashbacks (unless essential)
- "As you know, Bob" exposition

---

## Off-Screen Events

Deliver indirectly through:
- Dialogue recounting (incomplete, biased, contradictory)
- Documents (reports, texts, files)
- Messages (voicemails, emails)
- Interviews/interrogations

**Never dramatize scenes where no POV character is present.**

## Voice Test Checklist

Before finalizing any scene:
1. Could this be shorter?
2. Is every line doing work?
3. Do characters sound distinct?
4. Is there wit or tension?
5. Could reader follow with no tags?
6. Does it move?
