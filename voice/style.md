# Style Guide: Gregory McDonald-Inspired

## Core Principles

### 1. Dialogue-Driven Narrative
- **80-90% dialogue** — Text is mostly spoken words
- **Minimal tags** — Omit "he said" when speaker is clear
- **No adverbs** — Let rhythm carry meaning

### 2. Authorial Invisibility
- Set scene concisely, then disappear
- No internal monologue or commentary
- Reader is eavesdropper piecing things together

### 3. Sparse Prose
- Description minimal, always serves plot
- Use reader's visual bank—evoke with few details
- Where others use 7,000 words, aim for seven

### 4. Rhythm and Wit
- Fast, musical dialogue with banter
- Rapid-fire exchanges, interruptions, pivots
- Wit emerges from character, never forced

## Scene Opening Rules (CRITICAL)

### The Cold Open
**Open mid-sentence with an em-dash (—)** when possible. Drop reader directly into active dialogue or action already in progress.

Examples:
- "—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen..."
- "—forty-five thousand dollars for a weekend at the Ritz..."

**NEVER open with:**
- ❌ Atmospheric descriptions ("The kitchen smelled of...")
- ❌ Weather or time-of-day descriptions
- ❌ Character introspection
- ❌ "Establishing shot" prose
- ❌ Summaries of what's happening ("The MC had the room eating out of his hand")

**ALWAYS open with:**
- ✅ Dialogue already in progress (em-dash opening preferred)
- ✅ Character mid-action
- ✅ Conversation the reader walks into

**Eavesdropper Test:** Can reader feel they're overhearing a conversation that started before they arrived?

### Trust the Reader
- No hand-holding or setup
- Reader keeps up through context clues
- Action beats reveal information organically
- Let dialogue carry exposition

---

## Third-Person Close POV

- Use "he," "his," "him" for protagonist
- Stay extremely close to protagonist's consciousness
- **NEVER** use "He thought" or "He felt"—show through action
- No first-person ("I," "my") in narrative

### The "First-Person Feel" Techniques
- Dialogue dominates (80-90%)
- Behavior over interiority
- Only what POV character notices, in order noticed
- No explanations—jokes, subtext not spelled out

---

## Technical Rules

### Dialogue Tags & Beats
- Tags sparingly; prefer action beats for clarity
- Insert tag/beat if 3+ consecutive untagged lines
- Multi-character: avoid 5+ untagged lines
- Favor neutral "said" when tags needed
- **Speaker tags once per character** — After first identification, let context carry it

### Action Beats as Exposition
Instead of describing who someone is, show through action:
- ❌ "The tech CEO, a man in an expensive suit, raised his paddle"
- ✅ "A man in a tailored tuxedo nodded while holding up his paddle" (reader learns he's John through context)

Character details revealed through:
- What they do (action)
- What they say (dialogue)
- How others react (context)

### Prose
- Lean, active verbs
- Present action
- No adverbs
- Minimal adjectives
- Specific details over general descriptions
- Small, character-revealing details (golf glove tan line)

### Avoid
- Explaining jokes
- Characters stating feelings
- Excessive physical description
- Dream sequences, flashbacks (unless essential)
- "As you know, Bob" exposition

---

## Off-Screen Events

Deliver indirectly through:
- Dialogue recounting (incomplete, biased, contradictory)
- Documents (reports, texts, files)
- Messages (voicemails, emails)
- Interviews/interrogations

**Never dramatize scenes where no POV character is present.**

---

## Cinematic Techniques

### Background Action as Atmosphere
Use ongoing activity as backdrop while foreground dialogue/action continues:
- Auction running while characters talk at bar
- MC's voice weaving through conversations
- Characters moving through active environments

**Sorkin/West Wing approach:**
- Anchor character remains focal point
- Layered background activity continues
- Environment breathes with life
- Fast pacing with atmospheric establishment

### Meetings Feel Accidental
Characters don't "arrange to meet"—they end up in same space naturally:
- ✅ Character goes to bar for drink, other follows
- ✅ Eye contact across room, subtle signal
- ❌ "Let's meet at the bar in five minutes"

## Voice Test Checklist

Before finalizing any scene:
1. Could this be shorter?
2. Is every line doing work?
3. Do characters sound distinct?
4. Is there wit or tension?
5. Could reader follow with no tags?
6. Does it move?
7. Did scene open mid-action/dialogue?
8. Are you describing or showing?
9. Did you trust the reader to keep up?

## Sorkin-Style Rewrite Balance (CRITICAL FOR AI)

When applying Aaron Sorkin principles (fast dialogue, interruptions, rhythm) to McDonald-style prose, maintain this balance:

### **KEEP (Don't Over-Cut for Speed):**
1. ✅ **Physical business** - Characters doing things while talking (phones, movement, props, multitasking)
2. ✅ **Specific stakes** - Concrete details showing impact ("can't walk unassisted" vs vague "many prescriptions")
3. ✅ **Character observations** - Quirky details characters notice (reveals personality and attention)
4. ✅ **Running gags within ONE scene** - Maximum 2 beats per scene (setup + callback, then STOP)
5. ✅ **Business relationship clarity** - Explicit mentions of billing/payment/logistics when relevant
6. ✅ **Scene momentum** - Natural wind-down with button line, not abrupt cutoff

### **CUT (True Sorkin/McDonald Principles):**
1. ❌ Atmospheric scene-setting ("at ten PM, wearing ivory silk...")
2. ❌ Overwritten character descriptions in domestic/familiar scenes
3. ❌ Repeated attribution tags
4. ❌ Slow-paced exchanges waiting politely for responses
5. ❌ Explanatory dialogue that talks down to reader
6. ❌ Third+ mentions of same running gag in one scene

### **RUNNING GAG DISCIPLINE:**
- **Maximum 2 beats per scene** - Setup, then callback. Stop there.
- **Rarely carry between scenes** - What's funny in Scene 4 is stale in Scene 5
- **Exception:** Cross-episode callbacks work when spaced episodes apart
- **Warning sign:** If writing third mention of same joke in one scene, DELETE IT

**Example Structure:**
- ✅ Beat 1: "Three thousand" → "Four thousand" (setup/correction)
- ✅ Beat 2: "Three or four thousand" / "It was an hour ago" (callback reveals character)
- ❌ Beat 3: Third reference = overkill, reader is bored, cut immediately

### **Rewrite Verification Checklist:**
Before submitting Sorkin-influenced rewrites:

- [ ] **Physical actions present** - Minimum 2-3 gestures/actions per page (not just talking heads)
- [ ] **Stakes concrete** - Numbers, consequences, visceral impacts clearly stated
- [ ] **Running gags: 2 beats maximum** - Setup + callback, then DONE
- [ ] **Character texture preserved** - Observational quirks that reveal who they are
- [ ] **Business logistics clear** - Who pays, bills, or owes whom (when relevant)
- [ ] **Scene ending flows** - Natural button line with forward momentum
- [ ] **No joke fatigue** - Stopped before reader gets tired of the bit

### **Why This Balance Matters:**
Sorkin's speed without McDonald's texture = sterile dialogue transcript.
McDonald's texture without Sorkin's rhythm = plodding conversation.
Running gags past 2 beats = annoying repetition, not comedy.

**The Goal:** Fast, witty, physical dialogue where characters DO things while talking, stakes are visceral, and comedy knows when to stop.
