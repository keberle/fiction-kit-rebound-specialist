# Style Guide: Gregory McDonald-Inspired

## Core Principles

### 1. Dialogue-Driven Narrative
- **80-90% dialogue** — Text is mostly spoken words
- **Minimal tags** — Omit "he said" when speaker is clear
- **No adverbs** — Let rhythm carry meaning

### 2. Authorial Invisibility ⚠️ MOST VIOLATED RULE ⚠️
- Set scene concisely, then disappear
- No internal monologue or commentary
- Reader is eavesdropper piecing things together
- **ZERO psychological interpretation**
- **ZERO explanatory clauses**
- Trust reader completely—they don't need help

### 3. Sparse Prose
- Description minimal, always serves plot
- Use reader's visual bank—evoke with few details
- Where others use 7,000 words, aim for seven

### 4. Rhythm and Wit
- Fast, musical dialogue with banter
- Rapid-fire exchanges, interruptions, pivots
- Wit emerges from character, never forced

## Scene Opening Rules (CRITICAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### The Cold Open
**Open mid-sentence with an em-dash (—)** when possible. Drop reader directly into active dialogue or action already in progress.

**THE MCDONALD OPENING IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. Every scene must pass the eavesdropper test.

**Proven Examples:**
- "—come on, John. If you'll go to fifteen..."
- "—forty-five thousand dollars for a weekend at the Ritz..."
- **"Mother fu-"** (mid-profanity, action already happening)

**NEVER open with:**
- ❌ Atmospheric descriptions ("The kitchen smelled of...")
- ❌ Weather or time-of-day descriptions
- ❌ Character introspection
- ❌ "Establishing shot" prose ("The driving range at Hidden Hills looked...")
- ❌ Summaries of what's happening ("The MC had the room eating out of his hand")
- ❌ Setting up the scene for the reader ("They were at the golf course...")

**ALWAYS open with:**
- ✅ Dialogue already in progress (em-dash opening preferred)
- ✅ Character mid-action (mid-profanity works brilliantly)
- ✅ Conversation the reader walks into
- ✅ Someone reacting to something that just happened

**Eavesdropper Test:** Can reader feel they're overhearing a conversation that started before they arrived?

**WARNING:** If you open with scene description ("The practice facility had fifty bays..."), you have FAILED the McDonald opening rule. Delete it and start with action/dialogue.

### Trust the Reader
- No hand-holding or setup
- Reader keeps up through context clues
- Action beats reveal information organically
- Let dialogue carry exposition

---

## Third-Person Close POV

- Use "he," "his," "him" for protagonist
- Stay extremely close to protagonist's consciousness
- **NEVER** use "He thought" or "He felt"—show through action
- No first-person ("I," "my") in narrative

### The "First-Person Feel" Techniques
- Dialogue dominates (80-90%)
- Behavior over interiority
- Only what POV character notices, in order noticed
- No explanations—jokes, subtext not spelled out

---

## Technical Rules

### Dialogue Tags & Beats
- Tags sparingly; prefer action beats for clarity
- Insert tag/beat if 3+ consecutive untagged lines
- Multi-character: avoid 5+ untagged lines
- Favor neutral "said" when tags needed
- **Speaker tags once per character** — After first identification, let context carry it

### Action Beats as Exposition
Instead of describing who someone is, show through action:
- ❌ "The tech CEO, a man in an expensive suit, raised his paddle"
- ✅ "A man in a tailored tuxedo nodded while holding up his paddle" (reader learns he's John through context)

Character details revealed through:
- What they do (action)
- What they say (dialogue)
- How others react (context)

### Anti-Patterns (FORBIDDEN) — LLM Degradation Safeguards

**These patterns indicate attention drift. Delete immediately if found:**

❌ **Authorial Emotion Interpretation:**
- BAD: "smiling genuinely" → GOOD: "smiled"
- BAD: "laughed heartily" → GOOD: "laughed"
- BAD: "said warmly" → GOOD: "said" or delete tag entirely

❌ **Psychological Stage Direction:**
- BAD: "Something passed between them—an understanding, maybe"
- GOOD: [Delete. Show understanding through action/dialogue]
- BAD: "She felt a connection growing"
- GOOD: [Delete. Let reader infer from behavior]

❌ **Comparative Character State:**
- BAD: "with an ease that hadn't been there three days ago"
- GOOD: [Delete comparison. Just show current behavior]
- BAD: "more relaxed than she'd been earlier"
- GOOD: [Delete. Show relaxation through action]

❌ **Explanatory Clauses:**
- BAD: "for whatever social media empire he was building"
- GOOD: "for social media" or delete phrase entirely
- BAD: "presumably because she was nervous"
- GOOD: [Delete. Show nervousness through behavior]

❌ **Reader Hand-Holding:**
- BAD: "The joke landed well with the reporters"
- GOOD: [Delete. Show through reporter reactions]
- BAD: "They all understood what she meant"
- GOOD: [Delete. Let dialogue show understanding]

**Detection Rule:** If you can remove a phrase and the scene still makes sense, it was authorial commentary. Delete it.

**McDonald Purity Test:**
Read your paragraph aloud. Does it sound like:
- Dialogue → ✅ Keep
- Minimal stage direction → ✅ Keep  
- Author explaining things → ❌ Delete

---

### Environment as Character Exposition (CRITICAL)

**Use visible objects to convey character background. Show don't tell through what's on walls, desks, shelves.**

**WRONG: Describe character directly**
- ❌ "The broker was a fitness enthusiast who ran marathons"
- ❌ "He kept himself in excellent shape"
- ❌ Character talks about their accomplishments

**RIGHT: Show through environment**
- ✅ "Ironman triathlon finish shot, sail boat, golf tournament trophy, shots of the man with his trophy family"
- ✅ POV character observes and makes wry comment: "Outdoor sports?"
- ✅ Character reveals themselves through what they display

**Why this works:**
- POV character learns through observation, not interrogation
- Reader pieces together who this person is
- Character's choices about what to display reveals values
- Avoids on-the-nose exposition dialogue

### Character Worldview Over Biography (CRITICAL)

**NEVER give career exposition (years in business, accomplishments, revenue managed).**

**WRONG: Career details**
- ❌ "I've been doing this seventeen years"
- ❌ "I manage north of two hundred million"
- ❌ "Started on the floor, worked my way up"

**RIGHT: Show what character BELIEVES**
- ✅ "There are two types of investors: predators and prey"
- ✅ Character's philosophy about their field
- ✅ Character's ethics (or lack thereof) on display
- ✅ What they value, what they think about their work/world

**Why this matters:**
- Career details are boring and irrelevant to drama
- Worldview creates conflict and reveals character
- Philosophy generates dialogue tension
- Ethics create moral stakes

### Name Every Speaking Character (CRITICAL)

**Even one-scene characters must be named.**

- ❌ WRONG: "the broker", "the waiter", "the cop"
- ✅ RIGHT: "Phil Blakely", "Marcus", "Detective Martinez"

**Why this matters:**
- Specific > generic always
- Named characters feel real
- Reader tracks people better
- Shows respect for craft

### Prose
- Lean, active verbs
- Present action
- No adverbs
- Minimal adjectives
- Specific details over general descriptions
- Small, character-revealing details (golf glove tan line)

### Physical Business (CRITICAL)
**Minimum 2-3 physical actions per page.**

Characters must DO things while talking:
- ✅ Crouching near someone uncomfortably close
- ✅ Moving someone aside gently by the shoulders
- ✅ Picking up objects, handing them to others
- ✅ Gesturing, pointing, demonstrating
- ✅ Sipping coffee, checking phones, adjusting equipment

**NOT just:**
- ❌ "He said" / "She walked over"
- ❌ Generic movement without specificity
- ❌ Talking heads with no physical grounding

**Why this matters:**
- Physical actions reveal character (how Doogan crouches shows confidence)
- Creates visual cinema in reader's mind
- Prevents "radio play" dialogue
- Grounds abstract conversations in concrete reality

### Avoid
- Explaining jokes
- Characters stating feelings
- Excessive physical description
- Dream sequences, flashbacks (unless essential)
- "As you know, Bob" exposition

### Show Competence Through Demonstration (CRITICAL)

**WRONG: Summarize skill**
- ❌ "Doogan fixed her swing with one adjustment."
- ❌ "He knew exactly what to do."
- ❌ "She improved immediately."

**RIGHT: Show the process with real time**
- ✅ Let teaching sequences take TIME
- ✅ Include false starts and confusion
- ✅ Physical demonstration (picking up ball, adjusting stance)
- ✅ Student asks clarifying questions
- ✅ Multiple attempts before success
- ✅ Specific payoff (90 yards, crisp slicing sound)

**Example Structure:**
1. Problem identified specifically ("coming over the top")
2. Explanation with physical example (hands ball to student)
3. Student confusion/resistance ("But don't I have to...?")
4. Instructor clarifies, adjusts approach
5. First attempt (partial success)
6. Specific sensory payoff (sound, distance, feeling)

**Why this works:**
- Shows competence through demonstration, not summary
- Creates stakes (will this work?)
- Reader learns alongside character
- Payoff feels earned, not given

---

## Every Scene Must Be ABOUT Something (CRITICAL)

**Scenes are not information delivery vehicles. They are dramatic encounters.**

**WRONG APPROACH:**
- Scene goal: "Eddie needs to learn broker is healthy"
- Result: Eddie asks questions, broker answers, scene ends
- Problem: No dramatic content, just data transfer

**RIGHT APPROACH:**
- Scene goal: "Eddie meets morally dubious broker who pitches market manipulation"
- Result: Broker reveals worldview/ethics through sales pitch, Eddie observes health incidentally
- Success: Scene has dramatic content independent of plot information

**Every scene must have:**
- Character revealing worldview, ethics, or philosophy
- Moral position (even minor characters)
- Conflict or tension (even subtle)
- Something INTERESTING happening beyond exposition

**Give every character a philosophy:**
- What do they believe about their field?
- What are their ethics?
- How do they see the world?
- Let them make their case

### POV Character Responds to WHO, Not Information Need

**WRONG: POV character extracts needed information**
- ❌ Eddie asks about health to confirm medical records
- ❌ Questions probe directly for plot-required facts
- ❌ Character acts like interviewer checking boxes

**RIGHT: POV character responds to personality/ethics/energy**
- ✅ Eddie makes wry observation: "Outdoor sports?"
- ✅ Eddie reacts to WHO the person is (aggressive, sleazy, energetic)
- ✅ Eddie learns what he needs through observation and interaction
- ✅ Information comes as byproduct of authentic encounter

**Why this matters:**
- Characters feel real, not robotic
- Scenes have texture and personality
- Reader enjoys the encounter, not just the data
- Information lands more effectively when embedded in drama

## Off-Screen Events

Deliver indirectly through:
- Dialogue recounting (incomplete, biased, contradictory)
- Documents (reports, texts, files)
- Messages (voicemails, emails)
- Interviews/interrogations

**Never dramatize scenes where no POV character is present.**

---

## Cinematic Techniques

### Background Action as Atmosphere
Use ongoing activity as backdrop while foreground dialogue/action continues:
- Auction running while characters talk at bar
- MC's voice weaving through conversations
- Characters moving through active environments

**Sorkin/West Wing approach:**
- Anchor character remains focal point
- Layered background activity continues
- Environment breathes with life
- Fast pacing with atmospheric establishment

### Background Characters DO Things On Screen

**WRONG: Mention them**
- ❌ "Candy and Tilly were somewhere nearby"
- ❌ "He could see other competitors warming up"

**RIGHT: Show them in action**
- ✅ Candy arrives with press swarm, cherry red skirt too short for LPGA standards
- ✅ Tilly poses for photo with brand-new driver, then dribbles ball forward
- ✅ POV character watches, reacts, comments

**Why this works:**
- Background becomes foreground comedy
- Establishes character contrasts visually
- Creates earned moments (Mara smiling at Tilly's failure)
- Reader sees what POV character sees

### Meetings Feel Accidental
Characters don't "arrange to meet"—they end up in same space naturally:
- ✅ Character goes to bar for drink, other follows
- ✅ Eye contact across room, subtle signal
- ❌ "Let's meet at the bar in five minutes"

## Voice Test Checklist

Before finalizing any scene:
1. **DID SCENE OPEN MID-ACTION/DIALOGUE?** (If no, FAIL - rewrite opening)
2. Could this be shorter?
3. Is every line doing work?
4. Do characters sound distinct?
5. Is there wit or tension?
6. Could reader follow with no tags?
7. Does it move?
8. Are you describing or showing?
9. Did you trust the reader to keep up?
10. **Are there 2-3 physical actions per page minimum?**
11. **Do teaching/competence moments show the process, not summarize it?**
12. **Do payoff moments have specific sensory details?** (distances, sounds, feelings)
13. **Are you writing to entertain, or writing to avoid mistakes?**
14. **Is this scene ABOUT something beyond information delivery?**
15. **Do speaking characters have names (not "the broker")?**
16. **Did character reveal worldview/ethics, not career biography?**
17. **Did POV character respond to WHO, not extract data?**
18. **Did environment/objects convey background, not dialogue?**

## Critical Mindset: Entertain First

**WRONG MINDSET:**
- Writing to check boxes on requirements
- Avoiding mistakes rather than creating moments
- Following instructions literally without spirit
- Playing it safe

**RIGHT MINDSET:**
- Writing to entertain the reader
- Creating moments that surprise and delight
- Following the spirit of McDonald/King principles
- Trusting your instincts
- Making bold choices (mid-profanity openings work!)

**Remember:** A technically perfect scene that's boring has failed. A scene that breaks minor rules but entertains has succeeded.

## Sorkin-Style Rewrite Balance (CRITICAL FOR AI)

When applying Aaron Sorkin principles (fast dialogue, interruptions, rhythm) to McDonald-style prose, maintain this balance:

### **KEEP (Don't Over-Cut for Speed):**
1. ✅ **Physical business** - Characters doing things while talking (phones, movement, props, multitasking)
2. ✅ **Specific stakes** - Concrete details showing impact ("can't walk unassisted" vs vague "many prescriptions")
3. ✅ **Character observations** - Quirky details characters notice (reveals personality and attention)
4. ✅ **Running gags within ONE scene** - Maximum 2 beats per scene (setup + callback, then STOP)
5. ✅ **Business relationship clarity** - Explicit mentions of billing/payment/logistics when relevant
6. ✅ **Scene momentum** - Natural wind-down with button line, not abrupt cutoff

### **CUT (True Sorkin/McDonald Principles):**
1. ❌ Atmospheric scene-setting ("at ten PM, wearing ivory silk...")
2. ❌ Overwritten character descriptions in domestic/familiar scenes
3. ❌ Repeated attribution tags
4. ❌ Slow-paced exchanges waiting politely for responses
5. ❌ Explanatory dialogue that talks down to reader
6. ❌ Third+ mentions of same running gag in one scene

### **RUNNING GAG DISCIPLINE:**
- **Maximum 2 beats per scene** - Setup, then callback. Stop there.
- **Rarely carry between scenes** - What's funny in Scene 4 is stale in Scene 5
- **Exception:** Cross-episode callbacks work when spaced episodes apart
- **Warning sign:** If writing third mention of same joke in one scene, DELETE IT

**Example Structure:**
- ✅ Beat 1: "Three thousand" → "Four thousand" (setup/correction)
- ✅ Beat 2: "Three or four thousand" / "It was an hour ago" (callback reveals character)
- ❌ Beat 3: Third reference = overkill, reader is bored, cut immediately

### **Rewrite Verification Checklist:**
Before submitting Sorkin-influenced rewrites:

- [ ] **Physical actions present** - Minimum 2-3 gestures/actions per page (not just talking heads)
- [ ] **Stakes concrete** - Numbers, consequences, visceral impacts clearly stated
- [ ] **Running gags: 2 beats maximum** - Setup + callback, then DONE
- [ ] **Character texture preserved** - Observational quirks that reveal who they are
- [ ] **Business logistics clear** - Who pays, bills, or owes whom (when relevant)
- [ ] **Scene ending flows** - Natural button line with forward momentum
- [ ] **No joke fatigue** - Stopped before reader gets tired of the bit

### **Why This Balance Matters:**
Sorkin's speed without McDonald's texture = sterile dialogue transcript.
McDonald's texture without Sorkin's rhythm = plodding conversation.
Running gags past 2 beats = annoying repetition, not comedy.

**The Goal:** Fast, witty, physical dialogue where characters DO things while talking, stakes are visceral, and comedy knows when to stop.
