# McDonald Style Quick Reference — Anti-Drift Card

**Use this at the START of each scene request to override attention degradation.**

---

## CRITICAL OVERRIDE (Read First, Apply Absolutely)

You are writing Gregory McDonald Fletch style.

### Attention Mechanism Warning
If this conversation has 50K+ tokens, your attention weights are LOWEST on style rules in middle of context. You MUST consciously override statistical patterns.

---

## MANDATORY RULES (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Cold Open:** Em-dash mid-dialogue preferred (`"—absolutely, that's what..."`)
2. **Authorial Invisibility:** Set scene in 1-2 lines MAX, then disappear into pure dialogue
3. **ZERO Psychological Commentary:** No interpreting emotions for reader
4. **ZERO Explanatory Prose:** Trust reader to keep up
5. **80-90% Pure Dialogue:** Let characters talk, reader overhears
6. **Show Don't Tell:** Behavior only, no internal state

---

## EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN (Delete If Found)

### ❌ Authorial Emotion Interpretation
- "smiling genuinely" → "smiled"
- "laughed heartily" → "laughed"  
- "said warmly" → "said" or delete tag

### ❌ Psychological Stage Direction
- "Something passed between them" → DELETE
- "She felt a connection" → DELETE
- "He sensed her unease" → DELETE

### ❌ Comparative Character State

- "more relaxed than before" → DELETE
- "different from three days ago" → DELETE

### ❌ Explanatory Clauses

## DETECTION RULE

**Can you delete the phrase and scene still makes sense?**  
→ YES = It was authorial commentary = DELETE IT

---

## BEFORE WRITING EACH PARAGRAPH

Explicitly check:
1. Am I explaining instead of showing? → REWRITE
2. Am I interpreting emotions for reader? → DELETE
3. Am I adding narrative commentary? → DELETE
4. Would Gregory McDonald write this? → If NO, DELETE

---

## MCDONALD PURITY TEST

Read paragraph aloud. Does it sound like:
- ✅ Character speaking → Keep
- ✅ Minimal stage direction → Keep
- ❌ Author explaining → DELETE and rewrite

---

## GOLD STANDARD

**Could this paragraph appear in a Fletch novel unchanged?**

If NO → Why not? Fix that specific violation.

---

## TOKEN BUDGET CONSTRAINT

- Scene target: 600-800 words MAXIMUM
- 80% dialogue = 640 words spoken
- 20% action = 160 words stage direction
- Budget per paragraph: 3 lines MAX
- Force economy: Every word must justify existence
