## Serial Fiction Principles

### Installment Requirements
- **Length:** 2,000-6,000 words per installment
- **Hooks:** Episode openings hook within first paragraph
- **Cliffhangers:** Episode endings create forward momentum
- **Scene buttons:** Each scene ends on curiosity, not resolution

### Scene Structure
Every scene must have:
1. **Hook** — Opening that pulls reader forward
2. **Turn** — Something changes (revelation, decision, complication)
3. **Button** — Ending that propels to next scene

---

## Dialogue Clarity

- Insert action beats every 4-6 lines in rapid exchanges
- Use micro-actions to reinforce speaker identity
- "Reset" line when speaker changes or new character enters
- Multi-character scenes: never 5+ consecutive untagged lines

---

## Off-Screen Events (Fair-Play Rule)

**POV Anchor:** Each scene locked to one character's perspective.

**Indirect Delivery Methods:**
- Briefings from team members
- Dialogue recounting (incomplete, biased)
- Documents (reports, texts, emails, files)
- Messages (voicemails, recordings)
- Media (news clips, social posts)

**Emergency Cutaways (Rare):**
- 1-3 paragraphs maximum
- Objective and procedural only
- Never reveal info team shouldn't know

## Formatting Rules

### Dialogue
```markdown
"Dialogue goes in quotes," Doogan said.
"Action beat." Eddie tapped his tablet. "Continues dialogue."
*Internal thought in italics.*
```

### Tags & Beats
- New speaker = new paragraph
- Prefer neutral tags ("said")
- Action beats over dialogue tags when possible
